Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes \n(a “distributor ”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject \nto EU MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or  \nrefining the manufacturer s’ target marke t assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. The Issuer is not a \nmanufacturer for the purposes of the EU MIFID Product Governance Rules.  \nUK MIFIR PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPs ONLY TARGET MARKET  – \nSolely for the p urposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes \nhas led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Ha ndbook \nConduct of Bus iness Sourcebook (“ COBS ”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms \npart of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“ UK MiFIR ”); and (ii) all channels for \ndistribution of the Notes to eligi ble counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, \nselling or recommending the Notes (a “ distributor ”) should take into consideration the manufacturer s’ target market \nassessment; however, a distributor subject to  the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook \n(the “ UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules ”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of \nthe Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacture rs’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution \nchannels . \nPROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS  – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise \nmade available to and, should not be offered, sold or otherwise made avail able to any retail investor in the European \nEconomic Area (“ EEA ”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as \ndefined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the mean ing of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where \nthat customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II. Consequentl y, \nno key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “ EU PRIIPs Regulation ”) for \noffering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefo re \noffering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be  unlawful under the \nEU PRIIPs Regulation.  \nPROHIBITION OF SALES TO UK RETAIL INVESTORS  – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise \nmade available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom \n(“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point \n(8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union \n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“ EUWA ”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or \nregulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, as amended, where that customer would not qualify \nas a professio nal client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic \nlaw by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it \nforms part of domestic law b y virtue of the EUWA (the “ UK PRIIPs Regulation ”) for offering or selling the Notes or \notherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes \nor otherwise making them available to any ret ail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.  \n \n \n \n   \n Final Terms dated 27 February  2025 \nTOTALENERGIES CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL  \n \nIssue of EUR 850,000,000  3.499 per cent.
