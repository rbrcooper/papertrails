The relevant final terms \n(the “ Final Terms ”) (a form of which is contained herein) in respect of the issue of any Notes will specify whether or not such Notes will be li sted and admitted to trading and, if so, the \nrelevant stock exchange. \nEach Series (as defined below) of Notes will be represented on issue by a temporary global note in bearer form (each a “ Temporary Global Note ”) or a permanent global note in bearer \nform (each a “ Permanent Global Note ” and together with the Te mporary Global Note, the “ Global Notes ”).

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in that Relevant State of Notes which are \nthe subject of an offering co ntemplated in this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus as completed by final terms \nin relation to the offer of those Notes may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the relevant \nIssuer or any Dealer to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation or supplement a \nprospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regula tion, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the \nrelevant Issuer nor any Dealer has authorised, nor do they authorise, the making of any offer of Notes in \ncircumstances in which an obligation arises for the rele vant Issuer or any Dealer to publish or supplement a \nprospectus for any such offer. \nIf a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Dealers or any parent \ncompany or affiliate of the Dealers is a licensed broker or dealer in that juri sdiction, the offering shall be deemed \nto be made by the Dealers or such pare nt company or affiliate on behalf of th e relevant Issuer in such jurisdiction. \nThis Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus is to be read in conjunction with all documents which are incorporated \nherein by reference (see “ Documents Incorporated by Reference ”) and, in relation to any Series (as defined \nbelow), must be read and construed together with the relevant Final Terms. This Debt Issuance Programme \nProspectus shall, save as specified herein, be read and construed on the basis that such documents are so incorporated and form part of this  Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus. \nNo person has been authorised to give any information or to make any representation other than those contained \nin this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes and, if given or \nmade, such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorised by TotalEnergies SE, TotalEnergies Capital or TotalEnergies Capital Internatio nal or any of the Dealers or the Arranger (as defined \nbelow). Neither the delivery of this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus nor any sale made in connection \nherewith shall, under any circumstances , create any implication that there ha s been no change in the affairs of \nTotalEnergies SE, TotalEnergies Capital or TotalEnergies Ca pital International since the date hereof or the date \nupon which this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus has been most recently amended or supplemented or that \nthere has been no adverse change in the financial po sition of TotalEnergies SE, TotalEnergies Capital or \nTotalEnergies Capital International since the date hereof or the date upon which this  Debt Issuance Programme \nProspectus has been most recently amended or supplemented or that any other information supplied in connection \nwith the Programme is correct as of an y time subsequent to the date on which it is supplied or, if different, the \ndate indicated in the document containing the same. \nAny prospective investor purchasing the Notes under the Programme is solely responsible for ensuring that any \nsubsequent offer or resale of the Notes by such investor occurs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  \nIn this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus, the terms “ Noteholder ” and “ holder ” shall be construed to refer to \ninvestors that hold, as applicable, Notes, Receipts, Coupons and Talons (as applicable). \nThe Notes are complex financial instruments and may not be a suitable investment for certain investors. Each \npotential investor in the Notes should determine the suitability of such investment in light of its own \ncircumstances, have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits \nand risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus or any applicab le supplement to this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus, have access \nto, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evalua te, in the context of its particular financial situation, \nan investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes w ill have on its overall investment portfolio, and have \n \n3 sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear the risk s of an investment in the Notes, including the possibility \nthat the entire amount invested in the Notes could be lost. A potential investor should not invest in the Notes \nunless it has the knowledge and expertise (either alone or w ith a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will \nperform under changing conditions, the resu lting effects on the market value of the Notes, and the impact of this \ninvestment on the potential investor’s overall investment portfolio. Prospective investors should consult their own \nfinancial, legal and other advisers about risks associated with investment in a particular Series of Notes and the suitability of investing in the Notes in light of their particular circumstances. \nThe investment activities of certain investors are subject to  legal investment laws and regulations, or review or \nregulation by certain authorities. Neither the relevant Is suer, the Dealer(s), Agents nor any of their respective \naffiliates has or assumes responsibility for the lawfulness of the acquisition of the Notes by a prospective investor \nof the Notes, whether under the laws of the jurisdiction of  its incorporation or the jurisdiction in which it operates \n(if different), or for compliance by that prospective in vestor with any law, regulation or regulatory policy \napplicable to it. \nPotential purchasers and sellers of the Notes should be aw are that payments of interest on the Notes, or profits \nrealised upon the sale or repayment of Notes, may be su bject to taxation in their home jurisdiction or in other \njurisdictions in which it is required to pay taxes, includin g the relevant Issuer’s jurisdiction of incorporation, which \nmay have an impact on the income received from the Note s. In addition, in some jurisdictions, no official \nstatements of the tax authorities or court decisions may be  available for financial instruments. Potential investors \nare therefore advised to seek advice from their own tax a dvisers as to their individual taxation situation with \nrespect to an investment in the Notes. \nThe distribution of this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus and the offering or sale of the Notes in certain \njurisdictions may be restricted by law. Persons into whose possession this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus \ncomes are required by the relevant Issuer, the Dealers and the Arranger to inform them selves about and to observe \nany such restriction.  \nThe Notes and the Guarantee have not been and will not be  registered under the United States Securities Act of \n1933, as amended, or with an y securities regulatory authority of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States \nand the Notes are subject to U.S. tax law requirements. Subject to certain exceptions, Notes may not be offered, \nsold or delivered within the United States or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons (as defined in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder). For a description of certain restrictions \non offers and sales of Notes and on distribution of this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus, see “ Subscription \nand Sale ”. \nRetail investors are only eligible to subscribe for Notes if they possess sufficient knowledge and experience to be \nconsidered sophisticated investors and have sufficient financial capacity and an appr opriate investment horizon \nand risk tolerance. \nIMPORTANT – PRIIPS REGULATION / PROHIBITION  OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS – \nThe Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or \notherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “ EEA ”). For these purposes, \na retail investor means a person who is one (or both) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) \nof Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended (“ MiFID II ”) or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) \n2016/97, as amended (the “ Insurance Distribution Directive ”), where that customer would not qualify as a \nprofessional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information \ndocument required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as amended (the “ PRIIPs Regulation ”) for offering or \nselling the Notes or otherwise making them available to re tail investors in the EEA has been or will be prepared \nand therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise ma king them available to any retail investor in the EEA \nmay be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. \nIMPORTANT – UK PRIIPS REGULATION / PROHIBI TION OF SALES TO UK  RETAIL INVESTORS \n– The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or \notherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “ UK”). For these purposes, a retail \ninvestor means a person who is one (or both) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation \n(EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as \namended (the “ EUWA ”) or (ii) a customer within the meaning of  the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or \nregulations made under the FSMA to implement Directiv e (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify \nas a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) \n \n4 No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “ UK PRIIPs Regulation ”) for offering \nor selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be prepared \nand, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwis e making them available to an y retail investor in the UK \nmay be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. \nMIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE – The Final Terms in respect of any Notes will include a legend entitled \n“MiFID II Product Governance” which w ill outline the target mark et assessment in respect of the Notes, taking \ninto account the five categories referred to in item 19 of the Guidelines on MiFID II product governance \nrequirements published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ ESMA ”) dated 3 August 2023 and \nwhich channels for distribution of the Notes are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or \nrecommending the Notes (a “ distributor ”) should take into consideration the target market assessment; however, \na distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undert aking its own target market assessment in respect of the \nNotes (by either adopting or refining the target mark et assessment) and determining appropriate distribution \nchannels.  \nA determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether, for the purpose of the product governance \nrules under EU Delegated Directive 2017/593 (the “ MiFID Product Governance Rules ”), any Dealer \nsubscribing for any Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Notes,  but otherwise neither the Arranger nor the \nDealers nor any of their respective affiliates will be a manufacturer for the purpose of the MIFID Product \nGovernance Rules. \nUK MIFIR PRODUCT GOVERNANCE – The Final Terms in respect of any Notes will include a legend \nentitled “UK MiFIR Product Governance” which will outline the target market assessment in respect of the Notes, \nand which channels for distribution of the Notes are appropriate.

Issuer may, at its option, having given the appropriate notice, redeem \nthe Deeply Subordinated Notes of the relevant Series then outstanding (all, but not some only) at the relevant Early Redemption Price together \nwith interest accrued and Arrears of Interest (including any Additional \nInterest Amounts thereon) to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption on the latest practicable date on which the Issuer could make \npayment of the full amount payable without withholding or deduction \nfor French taxes, or, if such date is past, as soon as practicable thereafter. \nIf Redemption for Taxation Reasons is specified as applicable in the \nrelevant Final Terms and a Tax Deduction Event has occurred, the Issuer \nmay, at its option, at any time, having given the appropriate notice, \nredeem the Deeply Subo rdinated Notes of the relevant Series then \noutstanding (all, but not some only) at the relevant Early Redemption \nPrice together with interest accrue d and Arrears of Interest (including \nany Additional Interest Amounts thereon) to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, provided that the effective date of redemption of \nwhich notice thereunder may be given shall be no earlier than the latest \npracticable date preceding the effectiv e date on which the tax regime of \ninterest payments under the relevant Deeply Subordinated Notes is modified.  \n(e) Redemption \nfollowing an \nAccounting Event: \n If Redemption following an Accounting Event is specified as applicable \nin the relevant Final Terms and an Accounting Event has occurred, the \nIssuer may at its option, having give n the appropriate no tice, redeem the \nDeeply Subordinated Notes of the relevant Series then outstanding (all, \nbut not some only) at the relevant Early Redemption Price together with \ninterest accrued and Arrears of In terest (including  any Additional \nInterest Amounts thereon) to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption. \n(f) Redemption \nfollowing an Equity \nCredit Rating Event:  If Redemption following an Equity Credit Rating Event is specified as \napplicable in the relevant Final Terms and an Equity Credit Rating Event \nhas occurred, the Issuer may at its option, having given the appropriate \nnotice, redeem the Deeply Subordina ted Notes of the relevant Series \nthen outstanding (all, but not some only) at any time, at the relevant Early Redemption Price together with  interest accrued and Arrears of \nInterest (including any Additional Interest Amounts thereon) to, but \nexcluding, the date fixed for redemption. \n(g) Redemption \nfollowing an Acquisition Event: \n If Redemption following an Acquisition Event is specified as applicable \nin the relevant Final Terms and an Acquisition Event has occurred, the Issuer may, on giving not less than 10 nor more than 40 days’ irrevocable \nnotice to the Noteholders within the Acquisition Notice Period (or such \nother notice period as may be specified in the relevant Final Terms), at its option, redeem the Deeply Subordinated Notes of the relevant Series \nthen outstanding (all, or if so specified in the relevant Final Terms, some \nonly) at the Acquisition Call Redemption Amount (as specified in the relevant Final Terms), together w ith interest accrued and Arrears of \nInterest (including any Additional Interest Amounts thereon) to, but \nexcluding, the date fixed for redemption. \n(h) Issuer Clean-up \nCall Option: \n If a Clean-Up Call Option is specified as applicable in the relevant Final \nTerms and if 75 per cent. or any higher percentage than that specified in the relevant Final Terms (the “ Clean-up Call Percentage ”) of the initial \naggregate nominal amount of all Tr anches of Deeply Subordinated \nNotes of the same Series have been redeemed or purchased by, or on \nbehalf of, the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries and, in each case, \ncancelled, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Deeply Subordinated \nNotes of the relevant Series then outstandin g (all, but not some onl y), at \n \n15 the relevant Clean-up Call Price together with any interest accrued and \nArrears of Interest (including any Additional Interest Amounts thereon) \nto, but excluding, the date set for redemption, provided  that those Deeply \nSubordinated Notes of such Series that are no longer outstanding have \nnot been redeemed (and subsequently cancelled) by the Issuer at the \noption of the Issuer. \nSubstitution and Variation \n(for Deeply Subordinated Notes only): \n If at any time after the Issue Date the Issuer determines that a Tax \nDeduction Event, a Gross-Up Even t, a Withholding Tax Event, an \nAccounting Event or an Equity Cr edit Rating Event has occurred, the \nIssuer may, as an alternative to an early redemption of the relevant \nDeeply Subordinated Notes, at an y time, without the consent of the \nNoteholders and the Couponholders, (a) exchange the relevant Deeply \nSubordinated Notes for new notes (the “ Exchanged Notes ”), or (b) vary \nthe terms of the relevant Deep ly Subordinated Notes (the “ Varied \nNotes ”), so that in either case (i) in the case of an Accounting Event, the \naggregate nominal amount of the Exchanged Notes or Varied Notes (as \nthe case may be) is recorded as “equi ty” to the maximum extent possible \nin the consolidated financial statements of the Issuer pursuant to the \napplication of IFRS, (ii) in the case of a Gross-Up Event, payments of \nprincipal and interest in respect of the Exchanged Notes or Varied Notes \n(as the case may be) are not subject to deduction or withholding by \nreason of French law or published regulations, (iii) in the case of a \nWithholding Tax Event, payments of the full amount then due and \npayable in respect of the Exchanged Notes or Varied Notes (as the case \nmay be) are not prevented by French law, (iv) in the case of a Tax Deduction Event, payments of interest  payable by the Issuer in respect \nof the Exchanged Notes or Varied Notes (as the case may be) are \ndeductible to the extent permitted by the French law or (v) in the case of an Equity Credit Rating Event, to avoid any of the aggregate principal \namount of the Exchanged Notes or Varied Notes (as the case may be) \nwhich benefitted from equity credit by the relevant Rating Agency prior \nto the occurrence of the Equity Cr edit Rating Event being assigned a \nlevel of equity credit (or such other nomenclature that the relevant Rating Agency may then use to describe the degree to which an \ninstrument exhibits the characteristics of an ordinary share) is lower than \nthe equity credit assigned on the releva nt Issue Date (or if equity credit \nis not assigned on the relevant Issue Date, at the date when the equity \ncredit is assigned for the first time). The relevant Final Terms may \nspecify additional circumstances in which such Exchange Notes or Varied Notes may be issued.  \nAny such exchange or variation shall be subject to the conditions set out \nin Condition 5.9 ( Substitution and Variation ) of the Terms and \nConditions of the Deeply Subordinated Notes. \nTaxation: \n All payments of principal, interest and other revenues by or on behalf of \nthe relevant Issuer in respect of the Notes shall be made free and clear \nof, and without withholding or deduction for, any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charge s of whatever nature imposed, \nlevied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within France or any \nauthority therein or thereof having po wer to tax, unless such withholding \nor deduction is required by law. \nIf French law should require that pa yments of principal of, or interest \non, the Notes, Receipts or Coupons or  payments under the Guarantee be \nsubject to deduction or withholding with  respect to any present or future \ntaxes or duties whatsoever, the relevant Issuer or, failing whom, in \nrespect of Notes issued by TotalEnergies Capital or TotalEnergies \nCapital International, the Guarantor will, to the fullest extent then \npermitted b y law, pa y such additional amounts as  shall result in receipt \n \n16 by the Noteholders, or, if app licable the Receiptholders or the \nCouponholders, as the case may be, of such amounts as would have been \nreceived by them had no such withho lding or deduction been required, \nexcept that no such additional amounts shall be payable in respect of any Note, Receipt or Coupon presented for payment, as the case may be: \n(i) by a holder (or a third party on behalf of a holder) who is \nsubject to such taxes or duties in respect of such Note, Receipt \nor Coupon by reason of such holder having some connection with the Republic of France other than the mere holding of such Note, Receipt or Coupon; or \n(ii) more than 30 calendar days after the Relevant Date, except to \nthe extent that such holder would have been entitled to such additional amount on presenting  such Note, Receipt or Coupon \nfor payment on the last day of such period of 30 calendar days. \nInterest on the Notes:  The relevant Final Terms will specify which terms apply for the payment \nof interest (if any) on the Notes. \n(a) Interest Periods and \nInterest Rates: \n The length of the interest periods for the Notes and the applicable \ninterest rate or its method of calcul ation may differ from time to time or \nbe constant for any Series. Notes may have a maximum interest rate, a minimum interest rate, or both. Th e use of interest accrual periods \npermits the Notes to bear interest at different rates in the same interest \nperiod. All such information will be set out in the relevant Final Terms. \n(b) Fixed Rate Notes:  Fixed interest will be payable in arrear  on the date or dates in each year \nspecified in the relevant Final Terms. \n(c) Floating Rate \nNotes: \n Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate determined separately for \neach Series as follows: \n(i) on the same basis as the floating rate under a notional interest \nrate swap transaction in the relevant Specified Currency governed by an agreement incorporating the 2006 ISDA \nDefinitions (as published by the International Swaps and \nDerivatives Association, Inc.  (ISDA), and as amended and \nupdated as at the Issue Date of the first Tranche of the Notes of \nthe relevant Series), or the latest version of the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions (as published by ISDA as \nat the Issue Date of the first Tran che of the Notes of the relevant \nSeries) as specified in the applicable Final Terms; or \n(ii) by reference to such reference rate as may be specified in the \nrelevant Final Terms includin g EURIBOR, EUR CMS, SOFR, \nSOFR Compounded Index, SONIA or SONIA Compounded Index, \nin each case as adjusted fo r any applicable margin. \nInterest periods for Floating Rate Notes will be specified in the relevant \nFinal Terms. \n(d) Resettable Notes \n(for Deeply \nSubordinated Notes \nonly):  In respect of Deeply Subordinated Notes, only resettable Notes for \nwhich the interest rate shall be a fixe d interest rate resettable at different \nreset dates will be issued by the Issuer. \n(e) Benchmark \nDiscontinuation:  For Floating Rate Notes or Fixed-to-Floating Rate Notes, if a \nBenchmark Event occurs then the relevant Issuer may appoint an Independent Adviser in accordance with Condition 4(c) of the Terms \n \n17 and Conditions of the Senior Notes in the case of Senior Notes and \nCondition 5.6 of the Terms and Conditions of the Deeply Subordinated \nNotes in the case of Deeply Subordinated Notes, to advise the relevant Issuer in determining a Replacement Reference Rate and any applicable \nAdjustment Spread. \n(f) Fixed to Floating \nRate Notes: \n Fixed to Floating Rate Notes will bear interest (i) at a fixed rate as for \nFixed Rate Notes for a specified peri od and thereafter at a floating rate \nas for Floating Rate Notes or (ii) at a floating rate as for Floating Rate Notes for a specified period and ther eafter at a fixed rate as for Fixed \nRate Notes, as specified in the relevant Final Terms. \n(g) Zero Coupon Notes \n(for Senior Notes only):  Zero Coupon Notes may be issued at their nominal amount or at a \ndiscount to it and will not bear interest. \nInterest Deferral (for Deeply \nSubordinated Notes only): \n Optional Interest Payment \nInterest which accrues during an  Interest Period on the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes of any Series ending on but excluding an Interest Payment Date will be due on that Interest Payment Date (except in \nrelation to a payment of interest to be made on an Interest Payment Date \nfalling on the date of redemption of the relevant Deeply Subordinated Notes) unless the Issuer elects, at any time at its sole discretion, to defer \nsuch payment, in whole or in part, on the relevant Deeply Subordinated \nNotes, and the Issuer shall not have any obligation to make such payment and any failure to so pay shall not constitute a default by the Issuer under the Deeply Subordinated Notes or for any other purpose. \nAny interest in respect of Deeply Subordinated Notes of any Series \nwhich has been deferred on an Inte rest Payment Date shall constitute \n“Arrears of Interest ” and shall be payable as described below. \nPayment of Arrears of Interest \nArrears of Interest (together with any Additional Interest Amount (as \ndefined below)) in respect of the Deeply Subordinated Notes may at the \noption of the Issuer be paid, in whole or in part, at any time, provided \nthat all Arrears of Interest (toget her with the corresponding Additional \nInterest Amounts) in respect of all Deeply Subordinated Notes of any Series for the time being outstanding shall become due and payable in whole, but not in part, on whichever is the earliest of: \n(i) the tenth (10\nth) Business Days following the occurrence of a \nMandatory Payment Event; \n(ii) the next scheduled Interest Payment Date in respect of which \nthe Issuer does not elect to defer all or part of the interest \naccrued in respect of the relevant Interest Period; \n(iii) the date on which the Deep ly Subordinat ed Notes are \nredeemed; or \n(iv) the date upon which a judgment is made for the judicial \nliquidation ( liquidation judiciaire ) of the Issuer, or in the event \nof a transfer of the whole of the business ( cession totale de \nl’entreprise ) of the Issuer subsequent to the opening of a \njudicial recovery ( redressement judiciaire ) or in the event of \nthe voluntary dissolution of the Issuer or if the Issuer is \nliquidated for any other reason (and in all cases listed above \nother than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger or other reor\nganisation outside the context of an insolvenc y and \n \n18 where the resulting entity assumes the obligations of the Issuer \nunder the Deeply Subordinated Notes). \nEach amount of Arrears of Interest shall bear interest as if it constituted \nthe principal of the relevant Deeply Subordinated Notes at a rate which \ncorresponds to the rate of interest  from time to time applicable to the \nrelevant Deeply Subordinated Notes (the “ Arrears Interest Rate ”) and \nthe amount of such interest (the “ Additional Interest Amount ”) with \nrespect to Arrears of Interest shall be due and payable and shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent applying the Arrears Interest Rate \nto the amount of the Arrears of Interest and otherwise mutatis mutandis  \nas provided in the Conditions. \nThe Additional Interest Amount accr ued up to any Interest Payment \nDate shall be added in accordance with and to the extent permitted by \napplicable law to the amount of Arrears of Interest remaining unpaid on \nsuch Interest Payment Date so that it will itself become Arrears of Interest, for the purpose only of calculating the Additional Interest Amount accruing thereafter. \nOptional Partial Payment of Arrears of Interest and Additional Interest \nAmounts:  \nIf amounts in respect of Arrears of Interest and Additional Interest \nAmounts are paid in part: \n(i) all unpaid amounts of Arrears of Interest shall be payable \nbefore any Additional Interest Amounts; \n(ii) Arrears of Interest accrued for an y period shall not be payable \nuntil full payment has been made of all Arrears of Interest that \nhave accrued during any earlier period and the order of payment of Additional Interest Amounts shall follow that of the Arrears of Interest to which they relate; and \n(iii) the amount of Arrears of Interest or Additional Interest \nAmounts payable in respect of any of the Deeply Subordinated \nNotes in respect of any period, shall be pro rata  to the total \namount of all unpaid Arrears of Interest or, as the case may be, \nAdditional Interest Amounts  accrued on the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes in respect of that period to the date of payment. \nPurchase: \n The relevant Issuer, the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the Guarantor or \nthe relevant Issuer may at any time purchase Notes (provided that all \nunmatured Coupons and unexchanged Talons relating thereto are attached thereto or surrendered therewith) in the open market or \notherwise (including by way of tender or exchange offer) at any price \nsubject to applicable laws and regulations.  \nAll Notes so purchased by, or for the account of the relevant Issuer, may, \nat its sole discretion be held and resold or be cancelled, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  \nGoverning Law: \n The Notes, and the Receipts, Talons and/or Coupons relating to them (if \nany), will be governed by English law. In addition, the Agency Agreement will be governed by English law.  \nThe provisions of Condition 2 ( Status and Subordination of the Notes ) \nof the Terms and Conditions of the Deeply Subordinated Notes relating \nto the status and subordination will be \ngoverned b y, and construed in \n \n19 accordance with, French law. \nHowever, in the event of insolvency of the relevant Issuer or the \nGuarantor, the ranking of the claim against the bankruptcy estate \nrepresented by the Notes and the Guar antee will be determined by the \nlaw of the centre of main interests of the relevant Issuer or the Guarantor (as applicable). \nWaiver of set-off (for Deeply \nSubordinated Notes only): \n Subject to applicable law, no Noteholder may exercise, claim or plead \nany right of set-off, compensation or retention in respect of any amount \nowed to it by the Issuer in respect of, or arising under or in connection \nwith the Notes and each No teholder shall, by virtue of its holding of any \nNote, be deemed to have waived all such rights of set-off, compensation \nor retention. \nClearing Systems: \n Each Series of Notes will be represented on issue by a temporary global \nnote in bearer form (each a “ Temporary Global Note ”) or a permanent \nglobal note in bearer form (each a “ Permanent Global Note ”). Global \nNotes may (a) in the case of a Tranche of Notes intended to be cleared \nthrough Euroclear  Bank SA/NV (“ Euroclear ”) and Clearstream \nBanking, S.A. (“ Clearstream ”), (x) if the Global Notes are stated in the \napplicable Final Terms to be issued in new global note (“ NGN ”) form, \nbe delivered on or prior to the original  issue date of the relevant Tranche \nto a common safekeeper (the “ Common Safekeeper ”) for Euroclear and \nClearstream; or (y) in the case of Gl obal Notes which are not issued in \nNGN form (“ Classic Global Notes ” or “ CGNs ”) be deposited on the \nissue date with a common depositary on behalf of Euroclear and \nClearstream (the “ Common Depositary ”), and (b) in the case of a \nTranche intended to be cleared through  a clearing system other than or \nin addition to Euroclear, Clearst ream and Euroclear France SA \n(“Euroclear France ”) or delivered outsid e a clearing system, be \ndeposited as agreed between the relevant Issuer and the relevant Dealer. \nListing and admission to \ntrading:  Notes issued under the Programme may be listed and admitted to trading \non Euronext Paris and/or on any other stock exchange or may not be listed. \nMeeting of holders of Notes: \n The terms of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of holders \nto consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions \npermit defined majorities to bind all holders including holders that did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and holders that voted in a manner contrary to the majority. \nCredit ratings relating to \nTotalEnergies SE, the \nProgramme and the Notes: \n TotalEnergies SE is rated “A+” with stable outlook for long-term senior \ndebt and “A-1” for short-term senior debt by S&P Global Ratings \nEurope Limited (“ S&P ”) and “A1” with positive outlook for long-term \nsenior debt and “Prime-1” for short-term senior debt by Moody’s Deutschland GmbH (“ Moody’s ”). \nThe Programme has been rated “A+” for long-term senior debt, “A-1” \nfor short-term senior debt and “BBB+” for Deeply Subordinated Notes \nby S&P and “A1” for long-term senior debt, “Prime-1” for short-term senior debt and “A3” for Deeply Subordinated Notes by Moody’s.  \nTotalEnergies Capital and TotalEnerg ies Capital International are not \nindividually rated by both of the aforementioned rating agencies. As the \nSenior Notes issued by each of Tota lEnergies Capital and TotalEnergies \nCapital International are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by TotalEnergies SE, the ratings above with respect to the Programme will apply thereto, unless the Final Terms provide otherwise. \n \n20 Moody’s and S&P are established in the European Union and registered \nunder Regulation (EC) No. 1060/20 09 on credit ratings agencies, as \namended (the “ CRA Regulation ”) and included in the list of registered \ncredit rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets \nAuthority on its website ( www.esma.europa.eu/credit-rating-\nagencies/cra-authorisation ) in accordance with the CRA Regulation as \nof the date of the Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus. \nTranches of Notes issued under the Programme may be rated or unrated. Where a Tranche of Notes is rated, such rating will not necessarily be \nthe same as the ratings assigned to the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor or \nthe Programme. Where a Tr anche of Notes is rated, such rating will be \nspecified in the relevant Final Terms. \nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities \nand may be subject to suspension, re duction or withdrawal at any time \nby the assigning rating agency. Ratings  can come under review at any \ntime by rating agencies. \nInvestors are invited to refer to the websites of the relevant rating \nagencies in order to have access to  the latest ratings (respectively: \nwww.standardandpoors.com/  and www.moodys.com/ ). \nSelling Restrictions: \n The Notes are subject to restrictions on their offering, sale and delivery \nboth generally and specifically in th e United States of America, the \nUnited Kingdom, France, Japan, Canada, Hong Kong, the People’s \nRepublic of China, Singapore and the EEA. These restrictions are \ndescribed under “ Subscription and Sale ” of this Debt Issuance \nProgramme Prospectus. \nUnited States Selling \nRestrictions / TEFRA:  Regulation S, Category 2. The Final Terms with respect of any Tranche \nof Senior Notes will specify whethe r TEFRA Rules are applicable and, \nif applicable, whether TEFRA C or  TEFRA D is applicable. TEFRA \nRules are not applicable to the Deeply Subordinated Notes. \nUse of proceeds: \n The net proceeds from the issue of any Notes will be used to finance the \ngeneral corporate purposes of the relevant Issuer. If in respect of any \nparticular issue of Notes, there is a particular identified use of proceeds, \nthis will be stated in the relevant Final Terms. \nIf Redemption following an Acquisition Event is specified in the \nrelevant Final Terms, the use of pr oceeds for acquisition consideration, \ndirectly or indirectly, in whole or in part, and related fees will be stated \nin the applicable Final Terms. The Final Terms will also state the \npotential use for general corporate purposes if the Acquisition Event occurs but the relevant Issuer elects not to use the Redemption following an Acquisition Event. \n \n21 RISK FACTORS \nThe Issuers believe that the following factors may affect their ability to fulfil their obli gations under the Notes \nissued under the Programme and, as relevant, the Guarantor’s ability to fulfil its obligations under the Guarantee. \nAll of these factors are contingencies which may or ma y not occur. However, the Issuers have prepared the \nfollowing risk factors grouped by sub-category according to their nature and in each sub-category set forth below \nthe Issuers list first the risk that they consider to be the most material as of the date of this Debt Issuance \nProgramme Prospectus, in their assessment, taking into ac count the expected magnitude  of their negative impact \nand the probability of their occurrence.  \nFactors which the Issuers believe may be material for the purpose of assessing the mark et risks associated with \nNotes issued under the Programme are also described below. \nThe Issuers believe that the factors described below repres ent the principal risks inherent in investing in Notes \nissued under the Programme, but the inability of the Issuers to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in \nconnection with any Notes may occur for other reasons and the Issuers do not represent that the statements below \nregarding the risks of holding any Notes are exhaustive. Prospective investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Debt Iss uance Programme Prospectus (including any documents \nincorporated by reference herein) and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision. \nReferences in this section to “Conditions” in respect of the Senior Notes or the Deeply Subordinated Notes refer \nto the sections set forth under “Terms and Conditions of  the Senior Notes” or “Terms and Conditions of the \nDeeply Subordinated Notes” . \nFactors that may affect the Issuers ’ ability to fulfil thei r Obligations under Notes issued under the \nProgramme \nRisk Factors relating to TotalEnergies’ business  \nPlease refer to pages 130 to 139 of the TotalEnergies 2023 URD which is incorporated by reference in this Debt \nIssuance Programme Prospectus. The aforementioned business risk factors also apply to TotalEnergies Capital \nand TotalEnergies Capital International insofar as each act  as a finance company on behalf of TotalEnergies SE \nby issuing debt securities and/or commercial paper and th e Notes issued by such Issuers in the Programme are \nunconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by TotalEnerg ies SE pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee which \nprovide that, if for any reason TotalEnergies Capital or To talEnergies Capital International as the relevant Issuer \ndoes not pay any sum expressed to be payable by it under or in respect of a Note by the time, in the currency and \non the date specified in the Conditi ons (whether on the normal due da te, on acceleration or otherwise), the \nGuarantor shall pay that sum as if the Guarantor inst ead of TotalEnergies Capital or TotalEnergies Capital \nInternational were expressed to be the primary obligor in re spect of such Note to the extent that each holder shall \nreceive the same sum, in the same currency and at the same time as would have been receivable and applicable \nhad such payment been made by the relevant Issuer in accordance with the provisions  of the Terms and Conditions. \nTherefore, as a result of the foregoing,  the risks factors herein stated to be attributable to TotalEnergies SE or \nTotalEnergies are likewise extendable to TotalEnergie s Capital and TotalEnergies Capital International. \nThere are certain business risk factors that may affect the relevant Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s ability to fulfil their \nobligations under Notes issued under the Programme. Thes e business risk factors are related to the operations, \nindustry and the nature of TotalEnergies’ activities in general and accordingly by definition apply to Notes issued \nby TotalEnergies SE and or TotalEnergies Capital or TotalEnergies Capital International and guaranteed by \nTotalEnergies SE as the cash flows to service the Note s are almost all generated by TotalEnergies’ business \nactivities. \nTotalEnergies and its business are subject to various ri sks relating to changing competitive, economic, legal, \npolitical, social, industry, business and financial conditions. Its operations and profit could be affected mainly by: \n• Climate challenges: \n− Pace of deployment of the energy tr ansition, evaluation of demand; \n− Risk of legal actions; \n− Financing of oil and gas reserves;  \n \n22 − Operational risks relating to the effects of  climate change and of extreme events; \n− Reputational risk; and \n− Risk of skill management and evolution of the professions; \n• Market environment parameters: \n− Sensitivity of results to oil and gas prices, re fining margins, exchange rates and interest \nrates; \n• Risk relating to external threats: \n− Cybersecurity risks; and \n− Security risks; \n• Geopolitics and developments in the world: \n− Protectionist measures affecting free trade and economic sanctions regimes; \n− Deterioration of operating conditions; and \n− Regulatory developments; \n• Risks relating to operations: \n− HSE: risk of major accident or damage to third parties and the environment; \n− Development of major projects; \n− Business ethics; \n− Integration of strategic acquisitions;  \n− Supply chain management; and \n− Exposure to partnerships; \n• Innovation: \n− Technological development and digital transformation. \nRisk Factors relating to the Notes \n(A) Risks related to all Notes issued under the Programme Senior Notes and Deeply Subordinated Notes issued by TotalEnergies SE and Senior Notes issued by \nTotalEnergies Capital, TotalEnergies Capital International and guaranteed by TotalEnergies SE will be subject \nto risks associated with French insolvency law \nUnder the Programme, TotalEnergies SE may issue Se nior Notes or Deeply Subordinated Notes while \nTotalEnergies Capital and TotalEnergies Capital In ternational may issue Senior Notes guaranteed by \nTotalEnergies SE. TotalEnergies SE is a société européenne  (European company ( Societas Europaea  or SE)) \nincorporated in France with its registered office in France and each of TotalEnergies Capital and TotalEnergies \nCapital International is organized as a société anonyme (limited company) with its regi stered office in France. In \nthe event that TotalEnergies SE, TotalEnergies Capital or TotalEnergies Capital International becomes insolvent, \nthe relevant proceeding will be generally  governed by the insolvency laws of  France to the extent that, where \napplicable, the “centre of ma in interests” (as construed under Regu lation (EU) 2015/848, as amended) of \nTotalEnergies SE, TotalEnergies Capital or TotalEnergies Ca pital International, as the case may be, is located in \nFrance. Under French insolvency law, a société européenne  and a \nsociété anonyme  are subject to the same \n \n23 insolvency regime. French insolvency law may differ in wa ys that could be material from the insolvency laws of \nother jurisdictions.  \nAccording to French insolvency law,  “affected parties” (i.e., creditors, including the Noteholders, and equity \nholders whose rights, claims or interests are affected under a restructuring plan) deliberating on a restructuring \nplan shall be treated in separate classes which reflect cert ain class formation criteria fo r the purpose of adopting a \nrestructuring plan. Classes shall be formed by the judici al administrator in such a way that each class comprises \nclaims or interests with rights that reflect a suffi cient commonality of economic interest based on objective \nverifiable criteria. As a minimum, creditors, for their secured and unsecured claims, and equity holders shall be \ntreated in separate classes for the pu rpose of adopting a restructuring plan. A restructuring plan shall be deemed \nto be adopted by affected parties, provided that a two- thirds majority of the votes held by the members casting \na vote is obtained in each and every cla ss. If applicable, the class or classes of equity holders vote under the rules \ngoverning votes at shareholders/equity holders’ general meetings, except that the decision is taken at the same \ntwo-thirds majority. Within a class, the vote on the adoption of the plan may be replaced by an agreement which, \nafter consultation with its members, has received the approva l of two-thirds of the voting rights. If the restructuring \nplan is not approved by each and every class of affected parties, the plan may however  be confirmed by the court \nby applying a cross-class cram-down under  certain circumstances, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. \nThe commencement of insolvency pro ceedings against the relevant Issuer or the Guarantor would have a \nsignificant adverse effect on the market value of the releva nt Notes. As any other affected parties, the Noteholders \nwill be grouped into one or several classes (with potentia lly other types of creditors) and their dissenting vote may \npossibly be overridden by a cross-class cram down.  \nThe Notes are subject to modification and waiver of the Terms and Conditions in certain circumstances \nThe Terms and Conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters \naffecting their interests generally as provided under Condition 10(a) ( Meetings of Noteholders ) of the Senior Notes \nand Condition 9(a) ( Meeting of Noteholders ) of the Deeply Subordinated Notes. These provisions permit defined \nmajorities to bind all Noteholders incl uding Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and \nNoteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority . Further, in the event wher e a decision to modify the \nTerms and Conditions of the relevant Notes would be ad opted by a defined majority of Noteholders and such \nmodifications would impair or limit the rights of the Noteholders, this may have a negative impact on the market value of the relevant Notes.  \nIn the event of the occurrence of a Benchmark Event, modifications could be made to the Terms and Conditions \nof the relevant Floating Rate Notes to implement the ch anges required by determining an alternative benchmark \nand, if applicable, adjustment spread, without the cons ent of the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 4(c) \n(Benchmark Discontinuation ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes and Condition 4.6 ( Benchmark \nDiscontinuation ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Deeply Subordinated Notes. \nThe Terms and Conditions of the Notes also provide that the relevant Issuer and the Fiscal Agent may, without \nthe consent of Noteholders, agree for the purposes of, as de termined by the relevant Issuer and in each case in the \nopinion of the relevant Issuer, curing or correcting any ambiguity in any provision or correcting any defective \nprovision, of Notes or making a modification which is of a formal, minor or technical nature, changing the terms \nand conditions of the Notes in a manner that is not prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders, correcting a manifest error or complying with ma ndatory provisions of applicable la w, in each case in accordance with \nCondition 10(b) ( Modifications Without the Consent of the Noteholders ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior \nNotes and Condition 9(b) ( Modifications Without the Consent of the Noteholders ) of the Terms and Conditions of \nthe Deeply Subordinated Notes. Any of the foregoing could have a negative effect on the market value of the Notes. \nPartial redemption at the option of the relevant Issuer The Final Terms for a particular issue of Notes may provide for a partial redemption at the option of the relevant \nIssuer of the outstanding Notes under the particular Tranche (by way of an Optional Redemption (pursuant to \nCondition 5(d) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes and Condition 5.2 for Deeply Subordinated \nNotes), a Make-whole Redemption (pursuant to Condition 5( e) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes \nand Condition 5.3 for Deeply Subordinated Notes), a Residual Maturity Call Option at the option of the relevant \nIssuer (pursuant to Condition 5(f) of the Terms and Conditi ons of the Senior Notes), or following the occurrence \nof an Acquisition Event (pursuant to Condition 5(g) of  the Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes and \nCondition 5.8 for Deeply Subordinated Notes) subject to a certain notice period. A partial redemption of the Notes \n \n24 of any Series at the option of the relevant Issuer will be made at the price or prices specified in the applicable \nFinal Terms, which may, under certain circumstances, be below the then-prevailing market prices of such Notes. \nAs a result, the occurrence of partial redemption or the perception that it will occur may have material \nconsequences on the market value of such Series of Notes and, depending on the outstanding principal amount of \nsuch Series of Notes, render the trading market in respect  of such remaining outstanding Notes illiquid. In addition, \nsuch Series of Notes may after such partial redemption trade differently from the other similar instruments which \ndo not have such redemption provisions. \nAn investment in the Notes is subject to credit risk of TotalEnergies An investment in the Notes involves taking credit risk on  TotalEnergies. TotalEnergies Capital and TotalEnergies \nCapital International are finance vehicles as described under “ TotalEnergies Capital—Objects and purposes of \nTotalEnergies Capital ” and “ TotalEnergies Capital International—Object and purposes of TotalEnergies Capital \nInternational ”. The Notes issued by TotalEnergies Capital a nd TotalEnergies Capital International under the \nProgramme are unconditionally and irre vocably guaranteed by the Guarantor pursuant to the terms of the \nGuarantee as described under “ The Guarantee ” which provide that, if for any reason TotalEnergies Capital or \nTotalEnergies Capital International as the relevant Issuer does not pay any sum expressed to be payable by it under \nor in respect of a Note by the time, in the currency an d on the date specified in the Conditions (whether on the \nnormal due date, on acceleration or othe rwise), the Guarantor shall pay that sum as if the Guarantor instead of \nTotalEnergies Capital or TotalEnergies Capital Internationa l were expressed to be the primary obligor in respect \nof such Note to the extent that each holder shall receive the same sum, in the same currency and at the same time \nas would have been receivable and app licable had such payment been made by the relevant Issuer in accordance \nwith the provisions of the Terms and Conditions. For Note s under the Programme directly issued by TotalEnergies \nSE, TotalEnergies SE is the sole obligor. As a result, in either case, if the financial situation of TotalEnergies \ndeteriorates, the relevant Issuer and/or the Guarantor may not  be able to fulfil all or part of their respective payment \nobligations under the Notes and/or the Guarantee, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. \nAdditionally, if the credit risk of TotalEnergies becomes impaired, (i) the relevant Issuer and/or the Guarantor \nmay be unable to fulfil part of its payment obligations un der the Notes and (ii) the market value of the Notes may \ndecrease. \nForeign currency bonds expose investo rs to foreign exchange risk  \nNotes under the Programme may be issued in Euro, U.S. dollars, pound sterling or any other currency provided \nfor in the Final Terms. If an investor purchases Notes denominated in a currency other than that of such investor’s \njurisdiction of residence or place of in corporation, such investor is exposed  to the risk of changing foreign \nexchange rates, including possible significant changes in  the value of the Specified  Currency relative to the \ncurrency by reference to which such investor measures investment returns, due to, among other things, economic, \npolitical and other factors over which TotalEnergies has no  control. Depreciation of the Specified Currency against \nsuch currency could cause a decrease in the effective yiel d of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could \nhave a negative effect when the return on the Notes is tran slated into such currency. In addition, there may be tax \nconsequences for investors as a result of any foreign exch ange gains resulting from any investment in the Notes. \nAdditionally, if Notes are issued with Renminbi as th e Specified Currency, the aforementioned foreign exchange \nrisk may be greater due to the historically higher fluctuation of the value of such currency relative to other \ncurrencies, such as the U.S. dollar. The foregoing risks ar e in addition to any performance risk that relates to the \nrelevant Issuer, the Guarantor or the type of Note being issued. \n(B) Risks related to the market generally \nThe market value of the Notes may decline, the trading market may be volatile and each may be adversely \nimpacted by many events \nThe Notes under the Programme may be listed and admitted to  trading on Euronext Paris, unless another trading \nmarket is indicated in the applicable Final Terms. Therefor e, the market value of the Notes will be affected by the \ncreditworthiness of the relevant Issuer and, for Senior Notes, the Guarantor (as applicable), and/or that of \nTotalEnergies by economic and market conditions and, to varying degrees, interest rates, currency exchange rates \nand inflation rates in around the world. As a result, cred itworthiness of the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor or \nTotalEnergies deteriorates, (i) the market value of the No tes may decline which could have a significant effect on \nthe value of the Notes, (ii) could cause significant ma rket volatility for the Notes, which could in turn cause \nNoteholders to lose all or part of their investment. \n \n25 At any point in time there may or may not be an active trading market for the Notes \nWhile the relevant Issuer may purchase Notes in the ope n market or otherwise at any price in accordance with \nCondition 5(j) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes and Condition 5.10 of the Terms and Conditions \nof the Deeply Subordinated Notes, it is under no obligation to do so. For Noteholders to monetize their Notes \nprior to stated maturity or redemption (if applicable), there must be an active secondary trading market. At any \npoint in time there may or may not be an active trading mark et for the Notes of a particular Tranche. In addition, \nthe Dealers that participate in the di stribution of any issuance of Notes may make a market in the Notes as \npermitted by applicable laws and regulations but will have  no obligation to do so, and any such market-making \nactivities with respect to such Notes may be discontinued at  any time without notice. If any of the Notes are traded \nafter their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price. Among the factors that \ncould cause the Notes to trade at a disco unt are: an increase in prevailing interest rates; a decline in TotalEnergies’ \ncredit worthiness; the time remaining to the maturity; a weakness in the market or investor demand for our \nsecurities and for similar securities; and declining general economic conditions.  \nIn addition, the development or continued liquidity of any secondary market for the Deeply Subordinated Notes \nwill be affected by the complexity and volatility of the Refe rence Rate, the interest deferral provisions relating to \nthe Deeply Subordinated Notes (as provided in Condition 4.5 ( Optional Interest Deferral )), the level, direction \nand volatility of interest rates generally and, the rede mption features of the par ticular Series of Deeply \nSubordinated Notes, and whether or not TotalEnergies exercises its call options and the timing of any such \nexercise (as provided in Condition 5.2 ( Redemption and Purchase—Optional Redemption )). \nAn active trading market for the Notes may not develop, or , if one does develop, may not be maintained. If an \nactive trading market for the Notes does not develop or is not maintained, the market or trading price and liquidity \nof the Notes may be adversely affected. As a consequence, investors may not be able to sell Notes readily or at \nprices that will enable them to realise their anticipated yiel d and as a result, investors could lose all or part of their \ninvestment in the Notes. \nCredit ratings may not reflect all risks One or more independent credit rating agen cies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. As of the date of this Debt \nIssuance Programme Prospectus, the Programme has been rated “A+” for long term senior debt, “BBB+” for Deeply Subordinated Notes and “A-1” for short term senior debt by S&P and “A1” for long term senior debt, \n“A3” for Deeply Subordinated Notes and “Prime-1” for short term senior debt by Moody’s. The ratings may not \nreflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other \nfactors that may affect the market value of the No tes. Consequently, actual or anticipated changes in \nTotalEnergies’ or the Programme’s credit ratings may affect  the market value of the Notes, either positively or \nnegatively. However, because the return on the Notes is de pendent upon certain factors in addition to the relevant \nIssuer’s ability to meet its obligations  on the Notes, an improvement in TotalEnergies’ credit ratings will not \nreduce the other investment risks related to the Notes.  \n(C) Risks relating to all Senior Notes issued under the Programme and to  the structure of a \nparticular issue of Senior Notes \nThe following risk factors apply to Senior Notes issued by TotalEnergies SE and similarly to the Senior Notes \nissued by each of TotalEnergies Capital and TotalEne rgies Capital International that are irrevocably and \nunconditionally guaranteed by TotalEnergies SE under the Guarantee due to the unconditional and irrevocable \nguarantee granted by TotalEnergies SE in the Deed of Covenant described under “ The Guarantee ”, except as \notherwise noted and as indicated below under “— (B) Risks related to all Notes issued under the Programme—\nSenior  Notes and Deeply Subordinated Notes issued by TotalEnergies SE and Senior Notes issued by TotalEnergies \nCapital and TotalEnergies Capital International and guar anteed by TotalEnergies SE will be subject to risks \nassociated with French insolvency law ” \nSince TotalEnergies SE is a holding company and curren tly conducts its operations through subsidiaries, an \ninvestor’s right to receive payments on the Guarantee is subordinated to th e other liabilities of TotalEnergies’ \nsubsidiaries (other than the relevant Issuer) \nTotalEnergies SE is organized as a holding company, and substantially all of its operations are carried on through \nsubsidiaries. Additionally, TotalEnergies Capital and TotalE nergies Capital International are finance subsidiaries \nwhich rely on intragroup arrangements or recourse to the capital markets to meet their payment obligations. \nTotalEnergies SE’s principal source of income is the divi dends and distributions it recei ves from its subsidiaries. \n \n26 TotalEnergies SE’s ability to meet its financial obligatio ns as issuer or as guaran tor is dependent upon the \navailability of cash flows from its domestic and foreign su bsidiaries and affiliated companies through dividends, \nintercompany advances, management fees and other paymen ts. TotalEnergies SE’s subs idiaries will not guarantee \nthe Senior Notes and none of TotalEnergies SE’s subsidiaries will have any obligation under the Senior Notes, \nother than the applicable Issuer (as relevant). Moreove r, TotalEnergies SE’s other subsidiaries and affiliated \ncompanies are not required and may not be able to pay dividends to TotalEnergies SE. Claims of the creditors of TotalEnergies SE’s subsidiaries have priority as to the asse ts of such subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of \nTotalEnergies SE. Consequently, holders of Senior Note s that are guaranteed by TotalEnergies are in fact \nstructurally subordinated, upon TotalEnergies SE’s in solvency, to the prior claims of the creditors of \nTotalEnergies SE’s subsidiaries (other than the relevant Issuer) which would mean that recovery by Noteholders \nthrough the Guarantee under their investment in the event of an insolvency of TotalEnergies SE could be lower \nthan the recovery of creditors who have direct cl aims at TotalEnergies SE’s operating subsidiaries. \nIn addition, some of TotalEnergies SE’s  subsidiaries are subject to laws restricting the amount of dividends they \nmay pay. For example, these laws may prohibit dividend payments when net assets would fall below subscribed \nshare capital, when the subsidiary lack s available profits or when  the subsidiary fails to meet certain capital and \nreserve requirements. For example, French law prohibits those subsidiaries incorporated in France from paying dividends unless these payments are made out of distributable profits. These profits consist of accumulated, \nrealized profits, which have not been previously utilized, less accumulated, r ealized losses, which have not been \npreviously written off. Other statutory and general law obligations may also affect the ability of directors of \nTotalEnergies SE’s subsidiaries to declare dividends and the ability of TotalEnergies SE’s subsidiaries to make \npayments to TotalEnergies SE or the relevant Issuer on account of intercompany loans.  \nEach Noteholder’s investment in the Senior Notes will ther efore be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of \nTotalEnergies SE’s subsidiaries (other than the relevant Issuer, as applicable) which could significantly affect the \nrecovery in the event of an insolvency of TotalEnergies SE or the relevant Issuer. Additionally, as the terms of \nthe Senior Notes do not contain a negative pledge as discussed under “— The Senior Notes contain limited events \nof default and covenants ”, there is no requirement for operating subsidiaries to guarantee the Senior Notes \nconcurrently with any guarantee that is provided to ot her creditors pursuant to other indebtedness, which may \nhave a significant adverse effect on the value of an investment in the Senior Notes.  \nThe Senior Notes will be unsecured, and therefore an investor’s right to  receive payments may be adversely \naffected \nThe Senior Notes will be unsecured. The Senior Notes are not subordinated to any of the relevant Issuer’s or \nGuarantor’s (as relevant) other debt obligations, and theref ore they will rank equally with all such person’s other \nunsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness (save for certain mandatory exceptions provided by French law). There is no limitation on the relevant Issuer’s or the Guar antor’s ability to issue secured debt. As of 30 June 2024, \n$8,350 million of TotalEnergies SE’s non-current financial debt was secure d and as of the same date, each of \nTotalEnergies Capital and TotalEnergies Capital Interna tional had no secured indebtedness outstanding. If the \nrelevant Issuer of the Senior Notes defaults on the Senior Notes or if the Guarantor defaults on the Guarantee, or \nafter the bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the relevant Issuer or the Guarantor, then, to the extent the \nrelevant obligor has granted security over  its assets, the assets that secure that entity’s debts will be used to satisfy \nthe obligations under that secured debt before the obligor can make payment on the Senior Notes or the Guarantee, \nas applicable. There may only be limited assets available to make payments on the Senior Notes or the Guarantee \nin the event of an acceleration of the Senior Notes. If there is no t enough collateral to satisfy the obligations of \nthe secured debt, then the remaining amounts on the secured debt would share equally with all unsubordinated \nunsecured indebtedness (save for certain mandatory exceptions provided by French law). Therefore, the recovery \nof an investment in the Senior Notes following a default or after the bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the relevant Issuer or the Guarantor w ill necessarily be less than that of a debt obligation secured over collateral \nwhich could have material consequences for the value of a Noteholder’s investment. \nThe Senior Notes contain limited events of default and covenants \nUnless and until the Senior Notes are redeemed in accordance with the relevant Issuer’s redemption options or at \nthe option of the holders if specified in the Final Terms, th e Senior Notes will be repayable at their stated maturity \nor (if relevant) in accordance with the Amortisation Yield stated in the Fina l Terms. The holder of any Note may \nonly give notice that such Note is immediately due and repayable in a limited number of events as described in \nCondition 9 (Events of Default) of the Terms and Conditions. Such events of default do not include, for example, \na cross-default of the relevant Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s other debt obligations which would otherwise permit the Noteholders to declare the Senior Notes due and payable if the relevant Issuer or the Guarantor were to default \n \n27 on any other outstanding indebtedness over a certain threshold. Moreover, the Terms and Conditions of the Senior \nNotes do not contain any covenant regulating the incurrence of additional debt, a negative pledge or any other \ncovenants of the Issuers or the Guarantor which would otherwise require that security or guarantees granted to other creditors be equally and rateably granted to the Note holders. As a result, (i) the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor \nor subsidiaries of the Guarantor may freely incur additional debt and provide security, and subsidiaries of \nTotalEnergies SE may provide guarantees, in each case to ot her creditors without extending the same to the Senior \nNotes, (ii) if the relevant Issuer or the Guarantor defa ult on other outstanding indebtedness, it will not cause an \nacceleration of the Senior Notes and (iii) Noteholders will only have such pr otections and be able to exercise such \nremedies as contained in the Terms and Conditions and w ill not have any other rights to accelerate the maturity \nof the Senior Notes, each of which may have material consequences for the value of their investment. \nAny early redemption at the option of an Issuer, if provided for in any Final Terms for a particular issue of \nSenior Notes, could cause the yield anticipated by Noteholders to be considerably less than anticipated \nThe Final Terms for a particular issue of Senior Notes may provide for early redemption at the option of the \nrelevant Issuer of the entire outstanding under the particular Tranche or a portion thereof (including by way of \nMake-whole Redemption by the Issuer, a Residual Maturity Call Option, a Redemption following an Acquisition Event or a Clean-Up Call Option). If the market interest rates decrease, the risk to Noteholders that the relevant \nIssuer will exercise its right of termination increases. As  a consequence, (i) the yields received upon redemption \nmay be lower than expected, (ii) the redeemed face amoun t of the Senior Notes may be lower than the purchase \nprice for the Senior Notes paid by the Noteholder, (iii) pa rt of the capital invested by the Noteholder may be lost, \nwhich would have a significant adverse effect on the return obtained from such Noteholder’s investment. In \naddition, investors that choose to reinvest monies they receive through an early redemption may be able to do so \nonly in securities with a lower yield than the redeemed Se nior Notes that could have further negative consequences \nfor investors. See also “ —Partial redemption at the option of the relevant Issuer ”. \nThe following discusses the above risk as it may materia lise according to the different  redemption features that \ncan be provided in the relevant Final Terms for a particular Tranche of Senior Notes. \n• The Issuer has the option, if so provided in the relevant Final Terms, to redeem the Senior Notes, in \nwhole or in part, under a call option as provided in Condition 5(d) at the Optional Redemption Amount \nwhich will be specified in the relevant Final Terms, or all, or if so specified in the relevant Final Terms, \nsome only, of the Senior Notes outstanding under a Make-whole Redemption by the Issuer as provided \nin Condition 5(e) at the Make-whole Redemption Am ount, or in whole or in part under a Residual \nMaturity Call Option as provided in Clause 5(f), under a Redemption following an Acquisition Event as \nprovided in Clause 5(g), or in whole but not in part under a Clean-up Call Option as provided in Condition \n5(h).  \n• The Issuer has the option, if so provided in the releva nt Final Terms, to exercise a Residual Maturity Call \nOption, in whole or in part, as provided in Condition 5(f), and if the Issuer decides to redeem the Senior \nNotes pursuant to the Make-whole Redemption Option before the Call Option Date (as specified in the \nrelevant Final Terms), the calculation of the Make-whole Redemption Amount in respect of the Make-\nwhole Redemption Option will be calculated by refere nce to the relevant Call Option Date rather than \nthe relevant Maturity Date and, for the avoidance of doubt, the last remaining scheduled payment of \ninterest shall be deemed to fall on the Call Option Date (rather than the relevant Maturity Date) which \nwould result in a reduced rate of return on the Senior Notes than a Noteholder would have otherwise received pursuant to the Make-whole Redemption Amount calculated pursuant to the Terms and \nConditions of the Senior Notes for Series of Senior Notes where a Residual Maturity Call has not been \nspecified.  \n• The Issuer has the option, if so provided in the rele vant Final Terms, to exercise a redemption, in whole \nor in part, as provided in Condition 5(g) if the Is suer has not, on or prior to the Acquisition Longstop \nDate (as specified in the Final Terms), completed and closed the acquisition of the Acquisition Target \n(as specified in the Final Terms) or (ii) has publicly announced that it no longer intends to pursue the acquisition of the Acquisition Target. The probability and risks related to the non-consummation of the \nproposed acquisition of the Acquisition Target (as defined in the relevant Final Terms) may depend on a \nvariety of factors, including (but not limited to) securing competition, foreign investment and other regulatory approvals, obtaining consents from comme rcial counterparties or creditors of the Acquisition \nTarget, completing required employee consultation procedures and the implementation of TotalEnergies’ \nstrategy with respect to the particular Acquisition Targ et, some of which will be outside of the control of \nthe Issuer. Conversely, if the proposed acquisition of the Acquisition Target is not consummated, and the \n \n28 Issuer determines not to redeem the Senior Notes, th e Senior Notes will remain outstanding as obligations \nof the Issuer (and, as relevant, the Guarantor) an d the Acquisition Target will not become a member of \nTotalEnergies. \n• The Issuer has the option, if so provided in the rele vant Final Terms, to exer cise a Clean-Up Call Option, \nin whole but not in part, as provided in Condition 5(h) if 75 per cent. or any higher percentage than that specified in the relevant Final Terms (the “ Clean-up Call Percentage ” as defined in the relevant Final \nTerms) of a particular Tranche has been redeemed or repurchased; however, there is no obligation under \nthe Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes for the Issuer to inform investors if and when the Clean-\nup Call Percentage has been reached or is about to be reached, and the Issuer’s right to redeem will exist \nnotwithstanding that immediately prior to the serving of a notice in respect of the exercise of the Clean-\nUp Call Option, the Senior Notes may have been trading significantly above par, which could negatively affect the market value of the remaining outstanding Senior Notes. \nAn exercise of any of the foregoing early redemption options  by the relevant Issuer for a portion, but not all of, \nany particular Tranche of Senior Notes may also result in the materialisation of the risk factor discussed under \n“(C) Risks related to the market generally—The market value of the Notes may decline, the trading market may \nbe volatile and each may be adversely impacted by many events ”. \nThe market value of Senior Notes issued at a substantial discount or premium may fluctuate more than on \nconventional interest-bearing securities \nThe relevant Final Terms for a particular  issue of Senior Notes will indicate the issue price of the Senior Notes. \nThe market values of securities issued at a substantial discount or premium from their principal amount tend to \nfluctuate more in relation to general changes in intere st rates than do prices for conventional interest-bearing \nsecurities. Generally, the longer the remaining term of th e securities, the greater the price volatility as compared \nto conventional interest-bearing securities with comp arable maturities. The foregoing may have material \nconsequences on the liquidity and market value of the Senior Notes which could cause holders of such Senior \nNotes to lose all or part of their investment. \nZero Coupon Notes are subject to higher price fluctuations than non-discounted bonds \nSenior Notes issued under the Programme may be issued  without interest accruing in accordance with Condition \n1 (Form, Denomination and Title ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes and the interest will be \ndetermined in accordance with Condition 4(e) ( Zero Coupon Notes ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior \nNotes which permits the relevant Issuer to specify in th e applicable Final Terms that the Senior Notes shall be \nZero Coupon Notes. Changes in market interest rates have  a substantially stronger imp act on the prices of Zero \nCoupon Notes than on the prices of bonds such as Fi xed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes because the discounted \nissue prices are substantially below par. If market inte rest rates increase, Zero Coupon Notes can suffer higher \nprice losses than other bonds having the same maturity an d credit rating. Due to their leverage effect, Zero Coupon \nNotes are a type of investment associated with a partic ularly high price risk. Ther efore, in similar market \nconditions the holders of Zero Coupon Notes could be subject to higher losses on their investments than the \nholders of other instruments such as Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes. It is difficult to anticipate future market volatility in interest rates, but any such volatility  may have material consequences for the value of the \nSenior Notes. \nThe market value, the yield and/o r the liquidity of Fixed Rate Notes may be adversely affected  by interest rate \nmovements \nSenior Notes issued under the Programme may be issued w ith a fixed rate of interest in accordance with Condition \n1 (Form, Denomination and Title ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes and, as provided for in \nCondition 4(a) ( Interest on Fixed Rate Notes ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes, interest on its \noutstanding nominal amount will be determined at the rate per annum  (expressed as a percentage) equal to the \nrate of interest, with such interest being payable in a rrear on each Interest Payment Date. Investment in Senior \nNotes which bear interest at a fixed rate involves the risk  that subsequent changes in market interest rates may \nadversely affect the market value, the yield and/or the liquidity of the relevant Fixed Rate Notes as the price of \nsuch Fixed Rate Notes tends to move in an inverse relationship with the market interest rate, i.e.\n with the price of \nsuch a Fixed Rate Note decreasing when market interest rate increases, and the price of such a Fixed Rate Note \nincreasing when market interest rate decreases. As a cons equence of the foregoing, holders of Fixed Rate Notes \nmay lose part of their investment. \n \n29 Investors will not be able to calculate in advance their rate of return on Floating Rate Notes \nSenior Notes issued under the Programme may be issued  with a floating rate of interest in accordance with \nCondition 1 ( Form, Denomination and Title ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes and, as provided \nfor in Condition 4(b)(iii) ( Rate of Interest for Floating Rate Notes ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior \nNotes, the relevant Issuer can specify in the applicable Final Terms that the Floating Rate Notes will be determined \non the basis of a reference rate and a margin to be added or subtracted, as the case may be. A key difference \nbetween Floating Rate Notes and Fixed Rate Notes is th at interest income on Floating Rate Notes cannot be \nanticipated due to the periodic adjustment  (specified in the relevant Final Terms) of the reference rate which will \nitself vary depending on general market conditions.  \nDue to varying interest income, investors are not able to determine a definite yield of Floating Rate Notes at the \ntime they purchase them, so that their return on investment cannot be compared with that of investments having \nlonger fixed interest periods. If the Final Terms of the relevant Senior Notes provide for frequent interest payment dates, investors are exposed to the reinvestment risk if mark et interest rates decline. That is, investors may reinvest \nthe interest income paid to them only at the relevant lower interest rates then prevailing.  \nMarket volatility in interest rates, which is difficult to antic ipate, may therefore have a negative effect on the yield, \nthe market value and/or the liquidity of Floating Rate No tes and Noteholders could receive a lower or no interest \non such Senior Notes. \nRisks related to the conversion of Fixed to Floating Rate Notes \nSenior Notes issued under the Programme may be issued w ith a fixed to floating rate of interest in accordance \nwith Condition 1 ( Form, Denomination and Title ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes and, as \nprovided for in Condition 4(d) ( Fixed/Floating Rate Notes ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes, such \nFixed to Floating Rate Notes may bear interest at a rate that the relevant Issuer may elect to convert or that \nautomatically converts on a date specified in the relevant Final Terms from a fixed rate to a floating rate, or from \na floating rate to a fixed rate. The relevant Issuer’s ability to convert the interest rate or the automatic conversion \nof the interest rate on a date specified in the relevant Final Terms may affect the secondary market and the market \nvalue of the Senior Notes since (i) in the case where the re levant Issuer may elect to convert the interest rate, the \nrelevant Issuer may be expected to convert the rate when  it is likely to produce a lower overall cost of borrowing \nand (ii) where the conversion of the rate  of interest is automatic, such conversion as from the date specified in the \nrelevant Final Terms may not be favourable to the Notehold ers. If the rate of interest  is converted from a fixed \nrate to a floating rate, the spread on the Fixed to Floating Rate Notes may be less favourable than then prevailing \nspreads on comparable floating rate debt securities tied to  the same reference rate. In addition, the new floating \nrate at any time may be lower than the rates on other Seni or Notes. If the rate of interest is converted from a \nfloating rate to a fixed rate, the fixed rate may be lower than then prevailing rates on its Senior Notes. It is difficult \nto anticipate future market volatility in interest rates, but any such volatility may have a negative effect on the \nvalue of the Senior Notes as well as lead to the materialization of the risk described under “— Investors will not \nbe able to calculate in advance their rate of return on Floating Rate Notes ”. \nThe market continues to develop in relation to risk-free rates (including overnight rates) which are possible \nreference rates for Floating Rate Notes \nThe market continues to develop in relation to risk-fr ee rates, such as the Sterling Over Night Index Average \n(“SONIA ”) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“ SOFR ”) as reference rates in the capital markets and \ntheir adoption as alternatives to the relevant interbank offered rates. \nFurthermore, such risk-free rates have a relatively limited performance history and the future performance of such \nrisk-free rates is difficult to predict and may behave mate rially differently to interbank offered rates as interest \nreference rates. For example, since publication of SOFR  began, daily changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been \nmore volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmarks or other market rates. In addition, the manner of \nadoption or application of risk-free rates in the bond mark et may differ materially compared with the application \nand adoption of risk-free rates in other markets,  such as the derivatives and loan markets.  \nEach risk-free rate is published and calculated by third parties based on da ta received from other sources and the \nrelevant Issuer has no control over their respective dete rminations, calculations or publications. There can be no \nguarantee that the relevant risk-free rate (or the SOFR Compounded Index or SONIA Compounded Index) will \nnot be discontinued or fundamentally altered (or that any applicable benchmark fallback provisions provided for \nin the Conditions will provide a rate which is economically equivalent for Noteholders of Notes linked to or which \n \n30 reference such risk free rates). If the manner in which the relevant risk-free rate is ca lculated is changed, that \nchange may have a negative effect on the yield of the relevant Floating Rate Notes and the trading prices of such \nNotes. \nMoreover, interest on Notes which reference a risk-free rate is only capable of being determined immediately \nprior to the relevant Interest Payment Date and it conse quently may be difficult to reliably estimate the amount of \ninterest which will be payable on such Notes. Further, if the Senior Notes become due and payable under \nCondition 9 ( Events of Default ), or are otherwise redeemed early on a da te which is not an Interest Payment Date, \nthe Rate of Interest payable shall be determined on the date the Notes became due and payable and shall not be reset thereafter which could make difficult fo recasting the effective yield to redemption. \nThe use of risk-free rates as a reference rate for bonds  is still developing, and may be subject to change and \nrefinement, both in terms of the substance of the calculation and in the development and adoption of market \ninfrastructure for the issuance and trading of bonds referencing such rates. As a result, Floating Rate Notes referencing risk-free rates may have limited trading market  when issued, and an established trading market may \nnever develop or may not be very liquid which, in turn, may reduce have a negative effect on the trading price of \nthe Notes or the ability of Noteholders to sell such Notes at  all or at prices that will provide them with a yield \ncomparable to similar investments that  have a developed secondary market.  \nInsofar as the Final Terms for the relevant Tranche provide that the Specified Currency of the Senior Notes shall \nbe Renminbi, the availability of Renminbi outside of the PRC is limited, which may affect the liquidity of Notes \ndenominated in Renminbi, and the relevant Issuer may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to make payments \nunder Notes denominated in Renminbi in U.S. dollars  \nIf Renminbi is the Specified Currency of the Notes, payments will be effected in such currency unless the \nprovisions of Condition 6(h) of the Terms and Conditions of  the Senior Notes apply, in which case payments will \nbe effected in U.S. dollars. As a result of the restrictions by the PRC government on cross-border Renminbi fund \nflows, the availability of Renminbi outside the PRC is limited, which may affect the liquidity of Renminbi-\ndenominated Notes and the ability of the relevant Issuer a nd/or the Guarantor, if applicable, to source Renminbi \nto make payments thereunder.  \nAlthough it is expected that the offshore Renminbi market will continue to grow in depth and size, its growth is \nsubject to many constraints which are directly affected  by PRC laws and regulations on foreign exchange. New \nPRC regulations may be promulgated or the settlement ag reements relating to the clearing of RMB Notes between \nthe PBOC and its designated clearing banks in each offshore  Renminbi settlement centres may be terminated or \namended in the future, which may have the effect of further restricting the availability of RMB outside the PRC \nand consequently reducing the supply of Renminbi available for the relevant Issuer to use to source payments on \nRMB Notes. \nIf the relevant Issuer is not able, or it is impracticable for it, to satisfy its obligations to pay interest and principal \non the Renminbi Notes by reason of Inconvertibility, Non- Transferability or Illiquid ity (each as defined in \nCondition 6(h)), the terms of such RMB Notes allow the rele vant Issuer to make such payment in U.S. dollars at \nthe prevailing spot rate of exchange. Therefore, invest ors (i) holding RMB Notes may nonetheless receive U.S. \ndollars as payment thereunder in the circumstances set fo rth in Condition 6(h), and will have no rights to call an \nevent of default or acceleration as a re sult, and (ii) such investors may lose all or part of their investment when \nconverting U.S. dollars back into Renminbi, depending on the prevailing exchange rate at the time, each of which \nmay have a significant effect on the value of such RMB Notes. \nInsofar as the Final Terms for the relevant Tranche provide that the Specified Currency of the Senior Notes \nshall be Renminbi, payments with respect to Renminbi Notes may be made only in the manner designated in Renminbi Notes \nExcept in limited circumstances, all payments of Renmin bi under Renminbi Notes will be made solely by transfer \nto a Renminbi bank account maintained in Hong Kong in accordan ce with the prevailing rules and regulations for \nsuch transfer and in accordance with the terms and conditions of Renminbi Notes. The relevant Issuer cannot be \nrequired to make payment by any other means (including by transfer to a bank account in the PRC or anywhere else outside Hong Kong). If the custody and holding arrangements with respect to an investor’s RMB Notes do \nnot comply with the foregoing, such investors will be  may not receive timely payment under RMB Notes which \nwould negatively affect such investors’ return. \n \n31 Additionally, holders may of RMB Notes may be required to provide certifications and other information \n(including Renminbi account information) in order to receive payments in Renminbi. Finally, investors who \nreceive funds in Renminbi may not be  able to easily convert such sums into any other currency which may \nnegatively affect the value of their investment. \n(D) Risks relating to all Deeply Subordinated Notes issued under the Programme and to the structure \nof a particular issue of Deeply Subordinated Notes \nThe Deeply Subordinated Notes and the related Coupons are deeply subordinated obligations of the Issuer In accordance with Condition 2.1 ( Deeply Subordinated Notes ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes, the Issuer’s obligations under the Deeply Subordinated Notes and the related Coupons are \ndirect, unconditional, unsecured and deeply subordinated obligations ( titres subordonnés de dernier rang ) of the \nIssuer and rank and will rank pari passu  among themselves. Substantially all of the Issuer’s secured and unsecured \ndebt will rank senior to the Deeply Subordinated Notes issued under the Programme. As of 30 June 2024, \nTotalEnergies had $8,350 million of secured non-current financial debt and $34,176 million of unsecured non-\ncurrent financial debt. \nIn accordance with Condition 2.2 ( Payment on the Notes in the event of the liquidation of the Issuer ), in the event \nof any judgment rendered by any competen t court declaring the judicial liquidation ( liquidation judiciaire ) of the \nIssuer, or in the event of a transfer of the whole of th e business of the Issuer ( cession totale de l’entreprise ) \nsubsequent to the opening of a judicial recovery procedure ( redressement judiciaire ), or in the event of the \nvoluntary dissolution of the Issuer or if the Issuer is liquidated for any other reason (in all cases listed above, other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation, merger or other reorganisation outside the context of an \ninsolvency and where the resulting entity assumes the oblig ations of the Issuer under the Deeply Subordinated \nNotes and the related Coupons), the rights of Noteho lders and Couponholders to payment under the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes and the related Coupons, as the case may be will be subordinated to the full payment of the \nunsubordinated creditors of the Issuer (including holders of Unsubordinated Obligations), of the ordinary \nsubordinated creditors of the Issuer (including holders of Ordinary Subordinated Obligations), of lenders in relation to prêts participatifs , if any, granted to the Issuer and titres participatifs , if any, issued or to be issued by \nthe Issuer, if and to the extent that there is still cas h available for those payments. Thus, the Noteholders and \nCouponholders face a hi gher recovery risk than holders of unsubord inated and ordinary su bordinated obligations \nof the Issuer. In the event of incomp lete payment of unsubordinated creditors and subordinated creditors ranking \nahead of the claims of the Noteholders  and Couponholders, the obligations of  the Issuer in connection with the \nDeeply Subordinated Notes and the related Coupons shall terminate. The claims of the Noteholders and \nCouponholders under the Deeply Subordin ated Notes and the related Coupons,  as the case may be, are intended \nto be senior only to claims of shareholders. As of the date of this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus, there are currently no other instruments of the Issuer that rank junior to the Deeply Subordinated Notes or the related \nCoupons other than the ordinary shares of the Issuer. The ranking of the Deeply Subordinated Notes may have a \nsignificant adverse effect on return and recovery by Noteholders of Deeply Subordinated Notes as compared to Noteholders of Senior Notes which could result in (i) a loss of all or a part of a Noteholder’s investment in the \nevent of a bankruptcy and (ii) more volatility in the mark et price of the Deeply Subordinated Notes as compared \nto Senior Notes issued  under the Programme. \nThe Deeply Subordinated Notes will be issued as undated securities \nIn accordance with Condition 5.1 ( Final Redemption ), the Deeply Subordinated Notes will be undated securities, \nwith no specified maturity date. The Issuer is under  no obligation to redeem or repurchase the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes at any time and the Noteholders have no right to require redemption of the Deeply Subordinated Notes except, in accordance with Condition 8 ( Enforcement Events ), if a judgment is issued for the \njudicial liquidation ( liquidation judiciaire ) of the Issuer or, in the event of a transfer of the whole of the business \nof the Issuer ( cession totale de l’entreprise ) subsequent to the opening of a judicial recovery ( redressement \njudiciaire ) procedure, or in the event of the voluntary dissolution of the Issuer or if the Issuer is liquidated for any \nother reason (and in all the cases above, other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger or other \nreorganization outside the context of an insolvency wher eby the surviving entity assumes all obligations of the \nIssuer under the Deeply Subordinated Notes).  \nThe lack of a fixed maturity may have a significant adverse effect on Noteholders who must bear the significant \nfinancial risks of an investment in the Deeply Subordinated Notes for an indefinite period and may not recover \ntheir investment in a foreseeable future. \n \n32 The Issuer has the ability to defer payment of interest in respect of the Deeply Subordinated Notes \nIn accordance with  Condition 4.5 ( Optional Interest Deferral ), on any applicable Interest Payment Date, the Issuer \nmay elect to defer payment of all or part of the interest accrued on the Deeply Subordinated Notes to that date, \nand any such failure to pay shall not constitute a default by  the Issuer for any purpose. Any interest in respect of \nthe Deeply Subordinated Notes not paid on an applicable Interest Payment Date will, so long as the same remains \noutstanding, be deferred and shall constitute Arrears of Inte rest and bear interest, and may be payable in whole or \nin part as provided in Condition 4.5 ( Optional Interest Deferral ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes. \nAny deferral of interest payments or the perception that the Issuer will exercise its optional deferral right would \nhave a significant adverse effect on the market price of th e Deeply Subordinated Notes. In addition, as a result of \nthe interest deferral provisions of the Deeply Subordinated Notes, the market value of the Deeply Subordinated \nNotes may be more volatile than the market prices of ot her debt securities on which interest accrues that are not \nsubject to the above provisions and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Issuer’s financial \ncondition, therefore, investors may lose all or part of their investment. A deferral of interest may have a significant \nadverse effect for the value of the Deeply Subordin ated Notes or liquidity on the secondary market. \nThe Deeply Subordinated Notes may trade, and/or the prices for the Deeply Subordinated Notes may appear, in \ntrading systems with accrued interest. Purchasers of Deep ly Subordinated Notes in the secondary market may pay \na price which reflects such accrued interest on purchase of the Deeply Subordinated Notes. If one or several \ninterest payments are deferred, a purchaser of Deeply Subordinated Notes in the secondary market may not be \nentitled to the accrued interest (or part th ereof) reflected in the purchase pri ce of the Deeply Subordinated Notes, \nwhich could have a significant adverse effect for such Noteho lder and cause such Noteholder to lose all or part of \nthe value of such person’s investment  in the Deeply Su bordinated Notes. \nThe Issuer has no limitation on issuing or guaranteeing debt ranking senior or pari passu with the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes \nCondition 3 ( No Negative Pledge ) provides that there will be no negative pledge in respect of the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes. As a result of the foregoing, and the related lack of any covenant regulating the amount of \ndebt that the Issuer may incur, there is no restriction on the amount of debt, including senior and senior secured debt, which the Issuer may issue, or guarantee or secure. TotalEnergies SE an d its subsidiaries and affiliates may \nincur additional indebtedness or grant guarantees in re spect of indebtedness of third parties, including \nindebtedness or guarantees that rank pari passu  or senior to the obligations under and in connection with the \nDeeply Subordinated Notes. An increase of the outstanding  amount of such securities or other liabilities may, if \nsuch outstanding amount were to exc eed the assets of TotalEnergies SE, materially reduce the amount (if any) \nrecoverable by Noteholders on a winding-up of the Issuer and Noteholders could suffer loss of their entire \ninvestment if the Issuer were liquidated (whether voluntarily or not). If the amount of interests due under such \nsecurities or other liabilities increases it significantly increase the likelihood of a deferral of interest payments \nunder the Deeply Subordinated Notes which could in turn have a material consequences on the return of the Deeply Subordinated Notes. \nChanges in the Rate of Interest on the Deeply Subordinated Notes present particular risks Interest on the Deeply Subord inated Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates may \nadversely affect the value of the Deeply  Subordinated Notes. A Noteholder is exposed to the risk that the market \nvalue of the relevant Deeply Subordinated Notes could fall as a result of changes in the market interest rate. While \nthe nominal interest rate of the relevant Deeply Subordin ated Notes will be specified in the relevant Final Terms \nin accordance w ith Condition 4 ( Interest and deferral of interest ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes, the current interest rate on the capital markets (“ market interest rate ”) typically varies on \na daily basis. As the market interest rate changes, th e market value of the relevant Deeply Subordinated Notes \nwould typically change in the opposite direction. If the market interest rate increases, the market value of the \nrelevant Deeply Subordinated Notes would typically fall, until the yield of such Deeply Subordinated Notes is \napproximately equal to the market interest rate. If the mark et interest rate falls, the market value of the relevant \nDeeply Subordinated Notes would typically increase, until the yield of such Deeply Subordinated Notes is \napproximately equal to the market interest rate. The degree to which the market interest rate may vary is uncertain \nand presents a significant risk to the market value of the relevant Deeply Subordinated Notes if an investor were to dispose of such Deeply Subordinated Notes. \n \n33 In accordance with Condition 4 ( Interest and deferral of interest ), the Interest Rate in respect of the relevant \nDeeply Subordinated Notes will be reset as from the dates specified in the relevant Final Terms and as such is not \npre-defined at the Issue Date of such Deeply Subordinated Notes. Each reset Interest Rate may be different from the initial Interest Rate and may negatively impact the return under the relevant Deeply Subordinated Notes and \nresult in a reduced market value of the Deeply Subordinated Notes if an investor were to dispose of such Deeply \nSubordinated Notes. \nDue to the varying interest income on the Deeply Subordin ated Notes, potential investors are not able to determine \na definite yield of such Deeply Subordinated Notes at the time they purchase such Deeply Subordinated Notes and accordingly their return on investment cannot be compared with that of investments having longer fixed \ninterest periods, and this could have a negative effect on the expected return of an investment in the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes. \nThere are no events of default or cross default under the Deeply Subordinated Notes Condition 8 ( Enforcement Events ) provides that there are no events of default in respect of the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes or cross default under the Deeply Subordinated Notes. Compared to unsubordinated debt securities, including the Senior Notes issued under th e Programme, the Terms and Conditions of the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes do not provide for events of default or cross default allowing acceleration of the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes if certain events occur. As a result, (i) if the Issuer fails to meet any obligations under the \nDeeply Subordinated Notes, including the payment of any interest, investors will not have the right of acceleration \nof principal or default on other outstanding indebtedness, it will not cause an acceleration of the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes and (ii) upon a payment default, the sole remedy available to Noteholders and Couponholders for recovery of amounts owing in respect of any payment of principal or interest on the relevant Deeply \nSubordinated Notes will be the institution of proceedings to enforce such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, \nthe Issuer will not, by virtue of the in stitution of any such proceedings, be ob liged to pay any su m or sums sooner \nthan the same would otherwise have been payable by it, therefore, investors may lose all or part of their investment. \nAs a result, the value of the Deeply Subordinated Notes or liquidity on the secondary market may be negatively \naffected. \nThe Deeply Subordinated Notes are subject to early redemption risk \nThe Final Terms for a particular issue of Deeply Subordinated Notes may provide for early redemption at the \noption of the Issuer of the entire amount of Notes outsta nding under such particular Tranche or, in some cases, a \nportion thereof (including by way of  an Optional Redemption at the optio n of the Issuer in accordance with \nCondition 5.2 ( Optional Redemption ), a Make-whole Redemption by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 5.3 \n(Make-whole Redemption by the Issuer ), or at any time following the oc currence of a Gross-Up Event, a \nWithholding Tax Event, a Tax Deduction Event (in accordance with Condition 6.4 ( Redemption for Taxation \nReasons )), an Accounting Ev ent (in accordance with Condition 5.5 ( Redemption following an Accounting Event )), \nan Equity Credit Rating Event (in accordance with Condition 5.6 ( Redemption following an Equity Credit Rating \nEvent )), a Clean-Up Call Option (in accordance with Condition 5.7 ( Clean-Up Call Option )) or an Acquisition \nEvent (in accordance w ith Condition 5.8 ( Redemption following an Acquisition Event )) subject to the provision \nof certain notice. \nIn the event of an early redemption of the Deeply Subord inated Notes of any Series at the option of the Issuer \nfollowing the occurrence  of a Gross-Up Event, a Withholding Tax Ev ent, a Tax Deduction Event, an Accounting \nEvent, an Equity Credit Rating Event or a Clean-Up Call Option, such early redemption of the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes will be made at the Early Redemption Price specified in the relevant Final Terms together \nwith any accrued interest and Arrears of  Interest (including any Additional In terest Amounts thereon), as provided \nin Condition 5 ( Redemption and Purchase ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Deeply Subordinated Notes.  \nThe redemption of the Deeply Subordinated Notes by the Issu er or the perception that th e Issuer will exercise its \noptional redemption right (as applicable) might negatively affect the market value of such Deeply Subordinated \nNotes. During any period when the Is suer may elect to redeem the Deeply Subordinated Notes if specified by the \nrelevant Final Terms, the market value of the Deeply S ubordinated Notes generally will not rise substantially \nabove the price at which they can be redeemed. TotalEnergies SE may also be expected to redeem the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower th an the interest rate on the Deeply Subordinated Notes. \nNoteholders may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceed s at an effective interest rate as high as the return \nthat would have been received on the De eply Subordinated Notes had they not been redeemed. Potential investors \nshould consider reinvestment risk in light of other investment available at that time. \n \n34 An exercise of any of the foregoing early redemption options by the Issuer may also result in the materialisation \nof the risk factor discussed under “— (C) Risks related to the market generally—The market value of the Notes \nmay decline, the trading market may be volatile and each may be adversely impacted by many events ” for the \nperiod starting as of the announcement date to and including the optional redemption date. \nFor a description of certain risks which may result in the occurrence of an Accounting Ev ent, see the risk factors \nentitled “— The current IFRS accounting classification of financia l instruments such as th e Deeply Subordinated \nNotes as equity instruments may change, which may result in the occurrence of an Accounting Event ” and “—  \nOptional redemption, exchange or variation of the Deeply Subordinated Notes for tax, accounting or rating agency reasons ” below.  \nThe current IFRS accounting classification of financ ial instruments such as the Deeply Subordinated  Notes as \nequity instruments may change, which may result in the occurrence of an Accounting Event \nUnder current IFRS rules, financial instruments such as the Deeply Subordinated Notes are classified for \naccounting purposes as equity instruments but this may change as IFRS rules evolve over time and this may result \nin the occurrence of an Accounting Event. In such an even t, the Issuer will have the option to redeem all (but not \nsome only) of the Deeply Subordinated Notes (pursuant to Condition 5.5 ( Redemption following an Accounting \nEvent )). See the risk factor entitled “— The Deeply Subordinated Notes are subject to early redemption risk ” \nabove. Accordingly, the future cla ssification of the Deeply Subordinated  Notes may vary from an accounting \nperspective and such change may result in the occurrence of an Accounting Event, thereby providing \nTotalEnergies SE with the option to redeem the Deeply Subordinated Notes pursuant to the Terms and Conditions \nof the Deeply Subordinated Notes. The redemption of the Deeply Subordinated Notes by TotalEnergies SE or the perception that TotalEnergies SE will exercise its optional redemption right (if so specified in the relevant Final \nTerms) may negatively affect the market value of the Deeply Subordinated Notes.  During any period when \nTotalEnergies SE may elect to redeem the Deeply Subordinated Notes, the market value of the Deeply Subordinated Notes generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. \nIn November 2023, the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) published the exposure draft paper \nED/2023/5 on “Financial Instruments w ith Characteristics of Equity” (the “ ED/2023/5 Paper ”) which proposed \namendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures . Rules implemented as a result of the ED/2023/5 Paper \nor other initiatives of the IASB may in turn impact the earliest timing when an Accounting Event may occur \n(which could be earlier than the last day of application of the current IFRS rules) which may lead to an early \nredemption of the Deeply Subordinated Notes. \nDue to the listing of its shares (in th e form of American Depositary Receipt s) on the New York Stock Exchange, \nthe Issuer prepares its consolidated  financial statements in accordance with IFRS both as issued by the \nInternational Accounting Standards Board (“ IFRS-IASB ”) and as adopted by the European Union (“ IFRS-EU ”). \nAccordingly, the Issuer may be entitled to exercise its op tion to redeem the Deeply Subordinated Notes pursuant \nto an Accounting Event as a result of a change in accounting principles or methodology (or application thereof) either in IFRS-IASB or IFRS-EU.  \nTotalEnergies SE is not required to redeem the Deeply Subordinated Notes in the case of a Withholding Tax Event There is uncertainty as to whether gr oss-up obligations are legal or enfor ceable under French law. If gross-up \nobligations under the Deeply Subordinated Notes are held to be illegal or unenforceable under French law, the \nIssuer will have the right, but not the obligation, to red eem the Deeply Subordinated Notes. Accordingly, if the \nIssuer does not redeem the Deeply Subordinated Notes upon the occurrence of a Withholding Tax Event (as \nprovided by Condition 5.4(ii)),  holders of Deeply Subordina ted Notes may receive less than the full amount due, \nand the market value of the Deeply Subordinated Notes will be negatively affected. \nAny decline in the credit ratings of th e Issuer and/or the Deeply Subordinat ed Notes may affect  the market value \nof the Deeply Subordinated Notes and changes in rating methodologies may lead to the early redemption of the Deeply Subordinated Notes \nThe Issuer is currently rated A+ with a stable outlook by S&P and A1 with a positive outlook by Moody’s. The \nrating granted by each of S&P and Moody’s or any other rating assigned to the relevant Deeply Subordinated \nNotes as specified in the relevant Final Terms may not refl ect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, \nmarket and other factors that may affect the market va lue of such Deeply Subordinated Notes. Consequently, \nactual or anticipated changes in TotalEnergies’ or the relevant Deeply Subordinated Note’s credit ratings may \naffect the market value of such Deeply Subordinated Note s, either positively or negatively. However, because the \n \n35 return on the Deeply Subordinated Notes is dependent up on certain factors in addition to the Issuer’s ability to \nmeet its obligations on the relevant Deeply Subordinated Notes, an improvement in To talEnergies’ credit ratings \nwill not reduce the other investment risks related to such Deeply Subordinated Notes. \nIn addition, each of S&P and Moody’s or any other rating  agency may change its methodologies for rating issuers \nand securities with features similar to the Deeply Subordinated Notes in the future. This may include the \nrelationship between ratings assigned to an issuer’s senior securities and ratings assigned to securities with features \nsimilar to the Deeply Subordinated Notes, sometimes ca lled “notching”. If the rating agencies were to change \ntheir practices for rating such securities in the future and the ratings of the Deeply Subordinated Notes were to be subsequently lowered, this may have a negative impact on the trading price of the Deeply Subordinated Notes \nissued under the Programme. \nIf as a consequence of a change in the rating methodology of S&P or Moody’s, the relevant Deeply Subordinated \nNotes are no longer eligible for the same or higher category of equity credit attributed to the Deeply Subordinated \nNotes at their Issue Date, the Issuer may redeem all (but not some only) of the Deeply Subordinated Notes as \nprovided in Condition 5.6 ( Redemption and Purchase – Redemption following an Equity Credit Rating Event ). \nThe redemption of the Deeply Subordinated Notes by the Issu er or the perception that th e Issuer will exercise its \noptional redemption right (if so specified in the relevant Final Terms) might negatively affect the market value of \nthe Deeply Subordinated Notes. During any period when  the Issuer may elect to redeem the relevant Deeply \nSubordinated Notes, the market value of such Deeply Subordinated Notes generally will not rise substantially \nabove the price at which they can be redeemed. \nOptional redemption, exchange or variation of the Notes for tax, accounting or rating agency reasons There is a risk that, after the issue of a Series of Deep ly Subordinated Notes, a Tax Deduction Event, a Gross-Up \nEvent, a Withholding Tax Event, an Accounting Event or an Equity Credit Rating Event may occur which in \naccordance with Condition 5.9 ( Substitution and Variation ) would entitle the Issuer, without the consent or \napproval of the Noteholders or the Couponholders, to exchange or vary the relevant Deeply Subordinated Notes, \nsubject to not being prejudicial to the interest of the Noteholders and the Couponholders, so that after such exchange or variation, (i) in the case of an Accounting Ev ent, they would be recorded  as “equity” to the maximum \nextent possible in the consolidated fina ncial statements of the Issuer pursuant to the application of IFRS, (ii) in \nthe case of a Gross-Up Event, payments of principal and interest in respect of the relevant Deeply Subordinated Notes are not subject to deduction or withholding by reas on of French law or published regulations, (iii) in the \ncase of a Withholding Tax Event, payments  of the full amounts of principal and interest in respect of the relevant \nDeeply Subordinated Notes are not prevented by French law, (iv) in the case of a Tax Deduction Event, payments \nof interest payable by the Issuer in respect of the releva nt Deeply Subordinated Notes are deductible to the extent \npermitted by French law or (v) in the case of an Equity Credit Rating Event, to avoid any part of the aggregate principal amount of the Exchanged Notes or Varied No tes (as the case may be) which benefitted from equity \ncredit by the relevant Rating Agency prior to the occurrence of the Equity Credit Rating Event being assigned a \nlevel of equity credit (or such other nomenclature that the relevant Rating Agency may then use to describe the \ndegree to which an instrument exhibits th e characteristics of an ordinary share) that is lower than the equity credit \nassigned on the Issue Date (or if equity credit is not assi gned on the Issue Date, at the date when the equity credit \nis assigned for the first time). The relevant Final Terms may specify additional circumstances in which such Exchange Notes or Varied Notes may be issued.  \nUnless specified differently in the relevant Final Terms, su ch exchange or variation is subject to compliance with \ncertain conditions including not being materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders or the \nCouponholders as described in Condition 5.9 ( Substitution and Variation ) of the Terms and Conditions of the \nrelevant Deeply Subordinated Notes (and any additional conditions set forth in the relevant Final Terms). Any \nsuch substitution or variation may have a negative effect on the price of, and/or the market for, the Deeply Subordinated Notes. \nAlternatively, the Issuer reserves the right, under the same circumstances, to redeem all (but not some only) of the \nDeeply Subordinated Notes earl y as further described in “— The Deeply Subordinated No tes are subject to early \nredemption risk ” above and in Condition 5 ( Redemption and Purchase ) of the Terms and Conditions of the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes. \nIn such a case, an investor may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high \nas the interest rate on the Deeply Subordinated Notes bein g redeemed and may only be able to reinvest at a lower \nrate. \n \n36 The Terms and Conditions of the Deeply Subordinated Notes contain a prohibition of set-off \nIn accordance with Condition 2.3 ( Prohibition of set-off ), no Noteholder may exercise, claim or plead any right \nof set-off, compensation or retention in respect of any am ount owed to it by the Issuer in respect of, or arising \nunder or in connection with the De eply Subordinated Note s issued under the Programme and each Noteholder \nwill be deemed to have waived all such rights of set-off, compensation or retention, subject to applicable law. As \na result, a Noteholder which is also a debtor of the Issuer cannot set-off its payment obligation against any sum \ndue to it by the Issuer under the relevant Deeply Subord inated Notes. This prohibitio n of set-off co uld therefore \nhave a negative effect on the counterparty risk for a No teholder in the event that the Issuer were to become \ninsolvent. \n(E) Risks relating to Notes with  an interest rate calculated in reference to a benchmark \nReform and regulation of “benchmarks” may adversely affect the rate of interest on or value of such Notes \nIn accordance with Condition 4(b)(iii)(B) of the Terms an d Conditions of the Senior Notes and Condition 4.1 of \nthe Terms and Conditions of the Deeply Subordinated Notes,  the rate of interest in respect of certain Notes may \nbe determined by reference to reference rates that cons titute “benchmarks” for the purposes of Regulation (EU) \n2016/1011, as amended (the “ Benchmarks Regulation ”) published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June \n2016 and applied since 1 January 2018. \nInterest rates and indices which are deemed to be “bench marks” (in particular, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate \n(“EURIBOR ”) or the Euro Constant Maturity Swap (“ EUR CMS ”)) are the subject of recent national and \ninternational regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform \ndifferently from the past or disappear entirely or have other consequences that cannot be predicted. Any such \nconsequences could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and value of and return on any Notes linked to \nsuch a “benchmark”. \nIn particular, if the methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the \nrequirements of the Benchmarks Regulation, such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, \nincreasing or otherwise affectin g the level or volatility of the published rate of such benchmark. In addition, market \nparticipants may be discouraged from continuing to administer or contribute to such benchmark and the rules or methodologies used in the benchmarks may change, which may lead to the disappearance of the benchmark. Any \nof these changes, could have a material adverse effect  on the value of and return on any Notes linked to a \nbenchmark. \nThe potential elimination of any benchmark, the establishm ent of alternative reference rates or changes in the \nmanner of administration of any existing or new benchmark could also require adjustments to the terms of any \nNotes which pay a floating rate on interest. In particular, to the extent a benchmark is discontinued or is no longer \nquoted, the reference rate of such Notes may thereafter be determined in relation to a different benchmark. The replacement benchmark may perform differently from th e discontinued benchmark and may result in other \nconsequences, such as interest payments that are lower th an, or that do not otherwise correlate over time with, the \npayments that would have been made on such Notes if as such a benchmark was available in its current form. This could in turn impact the trading value of the affected No tes. In particular, in 2019, the method of determination \nof EURIBOR was changed by its administrator, the European Money Markets Institute (the “ EMMI ”). Because \nof the change in method, historical trends with respect to EURIBOR may not be indicative of trends that might apply on the basis of the new determination method. \nIf the relevant reference rate ceases to be calculated or ad ministered and no alternative ba se rate is identified, this \nmay result in the relevant reference rate no longer being available or being subject to replacement, and the interest \nrate on such Notes will accrue at the last relevant rate  plus the Margin, potentially converting such Notes into \nfixed rate instruments. \nAny of the above changes or any other consequential changes to benchmarks as a result of European Union, \nUnited Kingdom, or other international, national, or other proposals for reform or other initiatives or \ninvestigations, or any further uncertainty in relation to the timing and manner of implementation of such changes \ncould have a material adverse effect on the trading market for, value of and return on the Notes. \nThe Benchmarks Regulation was further amended by Regulation (EU) 2021/168 of the European Parliament and \nof the Council of 10 February 2021 (the “ Amending Regulation ”) which introduces a harmonised approach to \ndeal with the cessation or winddown of certain benchmarks by conferring the power to designate a statutory \n \n37 replacement for certain benchmarks on the Commission or the relevant national authority. This replacement could \nhave a negative impact on the value or liquidity of, and return on, certain Notes issued under the Programme \nlinked to or referencing such benchmark and may not operate as intended at the relevant time or may perform differently from the discontinued or otherwise unavailabl e benchmark. However, there are still some uncertainties \nas to the application of these regulatory provisions pending the implementing acts of the European Commission. \nIn addition, the Amending Regulation ex tended the transitional provisions applicable to third-country benchmarks \nuntil the end of 2025. Such developments may create uncerta inty regarding any future legislative or regulatory \nrequirements arising from the implemen tation of delegated regulations. More broadly, any of the international or \nnational reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of  a benchmark and complying with any such regulations \nor requirements.  \nIt is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, EURIBOR and other benchmarks will \ncontinue to be supported going forward. This may cause these benchmarks to perform differently than they have done in the past, and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Such factors may have (without \nlimitation) the following effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to \nadminister or contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark and/or (iii) leading to th e disappearance of the benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other \nconsequential changes as a result of international or natio nal reforms or other initiatives or investigations, could \nhave a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any Notes linked to, referencing, or otherwise dependent (in whole or in part) upon, a benchmark. \nIf a benchmark is discontinued, the rate of interest on the Notes linked to or referencing such a benchmark will \nbe changed in ways which may be adve rse to holders of such Notes, without any requirement that the consent of \nsuch holders be obtained  \nIn relation to Floating Rate Notes issued under the Pr ogramme, for EURIBOR and EUR CMS, in the event that \nthe reference rate is temporarily unavailable, the Calcul ation Agent is permitted to obtain quotations from banks \nactive in those markets and determine the reference rate through arithmetic mean as further detailed in Condition 4(b)(iii)(B)(I)(y) and (z), which may be less efficient th an if such rate was calculated by an information agency. \nFurthermore, in the event of a “Benchma rk Event” in relation to the Senior Notes or, in the event of a “Mid-Swap \nBenchmark Event” in relation to the Deeply Subordinated  Notes, pursuant to the fallback provisions for reference \nrate calculation under the Notes, the relevant Issuer will (at its own cost) appoint an independent financial \ninstitution of international repute or an independent advise r of recognised standing with appropriate expertise (the \n“Independent Adviser ”) who will advise the relevant Issuer in  determining a successor or replacement rate, \npermitting the relevant Issuer, acting in good faith, in a commercially reasonable manner to make necessary \nchanges to the business day convention, the definition of business day, the interest determination date, the day count fraction and any method for calculating the replacem ent rate, including any adjustment factor needed to \nmake such replacement rate comparable to the relevant reference rate.  \nSuch replacement rate will (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding, and no consent of the \nNoteholders shall be required in connection with effec ting any replacement rate, any other related adjustments \nand/or amendments to the terms and conditions of the re levant Notes (or any other document) which are made in \norder to effect such replacement rate . See Condition 4(c) of the Terms and Conditions of the Senior Notes and \nCondition 4.6 of the Terms and Conditions of the Deeply Subordinated Notes for more information regarding the \nbenchmark discontinuation provisions.  \nNotwithstanding the fallback provisions relating to “Mid-Swap Benchmark Event” discussed above, no \nreplacement rate will be adopted, nor will the applicable ad justment spread be applied, nor will any other related \nadjustments and/or amendments to the Terms and Conditions  of the Deeply Subordinated Notes be made, if and \nto the extent that, in the determination of the relevant Issuer, the same could reasonabl y be expected to (i) result \nin a reduction of the amount of “equity credit” assigned to the Deeply Subordinated Notes by any Rating Agency when compared to the “equity credit” assigned to the Deeply Subordinated Notes immediately prior to the \noccurrence of the relevant Benchmark Event from such Ra ting Agency or (ii) otherwise prejudice the eligibility \nof the Deeply Subordinated Notes for “equity credit” from any Rating Agency. \nThe replacement rate may have no or very limited trading history and accordingly its general evolution and/or \ninteraction with other relevant market forces or elements  may be difficult to determine or measure. In addition, \ngiven the uncertainty concerning the availability of a replacement rate and the involvement of an agent, the \nfallback provisions may not operate as intended at the relevant time and the replacement rate may perform differently from the discontinued Benchmark. Any adjustment factor applied to any series of Notes may not \n \n38 adequately compensate such impact. This could in turn have  a negative effect on the rate of interest on and trading \nvalue of the affected Notes. \nAlternatively, if the relevant Issuer is unable to appoint an Independent Adviser or if the Independent Adviser is \nunable to or otherwise does not advise the relevant Issu er a replacement rate, then no such successor, replacement \nor alternative benchmark or Screen Page  will be adopted and the Rate of Interest will be equal to the last reference \navailable on relevant Screen Page or from the benchmark (as applicable). This could result in the effective \napplication of a fixed rate to the Notes. As a consequen ce, the Noteholders may receive less than they would have \nreceived in the absence of a Benchmark Event, which could have a negative e ffect on the rate of interest on and \ntrading value of the affected Notes.  \nNoteholders that enter into hedging instruments based on the relevant reference rate may find their hedges to be \nineffective, and they may incur costs replacing such he dges with instruments tied to  the replacement rate. When \nsuch Notes are effectively converted into fixed rate instruments, Noteholders might incur costs from unwinding \nhedges. Moreover, in a rising interest rate environment, No teholders will not, if the Notes are converted into fixed \nrate instrument benefit from any incr ease in rates. The trading value of the Notes could as a consequence be \nadversely affected. \n \n39 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \nTotalEnergies has made certain forward-looking statements in this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus and in \nthe documents referred to in, or incorporated by reference into, this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus. This \ndocument may contain forward-looking statements with re spect to the financial condition, results of operations, \nbusiness activities and industrial strategy of TotalEnergie s. This document may also contain statements regarding \nthe perspectives, objectives, areas of improvements and goals of TotalEne rgies, including with respect to climate \nchange and carbon neutrality (net zero emissions). An am bition expresses an outcome desired by TotalEnergies, \nit being specified that the means to be deployed do not depend solely on TotalEnergie s. These forward-looking \nstatements may generally be identified by the use of the fu ture or conditional tense or forward-looking words such \nas “envisions”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “co nsiders”, “plans”, “expects”, “thinks”, “targets”, “aims” \nor similar terminology. Such forward-looking statements included in this document are based on economic data, \nestimates and assumptions prepared in  a given economic, competitive and regulatory environment and considered \nto be reasonable by TotalEnergies as of the date of this document. \nThese forward-looking statements are not historical data and should not be interpreted as assurances that the \nperspectives, objectives or goals announced will be achiev ed. They may prove to be inaccurate in the future, and \nmay evolve or be modified with a significant difference between the actual results and those initially estimated, \ndue to the uncertainties notably related to the economic, financial, competitive and regulatory environment, or \ndue to the occurrence of risk factors, such as, notably, the price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas, the evolution of the demand and price of petroleum products, the changes in production results and reserves estimates, \nthe ability to achieve cost reductions and operating effi ciencies without unduly disrupting business operations, \nchanges in laws and regulations including those related to the environment and climat e, currency fluctuations, \ntechnological innovations, meteorological conditions and events, as well as socio-demographic, economic and \npolitical developments, changes in market conditions, loss of market share and changes in consumer preferences, \nor pandemics such as COVID-19. Additionally, certain fina ncial information is based on estimates particularly in \nthe assessment of the recoverable value of assets an d potential impairments of assets relating thereto. \nExcept for its ongoing obligations to disclose material  information as required by applicable securities laws, \nTotalEnergies does not have any intention or obligation to update forward-looking statements after the distribution \nof this document, even if new information, future events or other circumstances have made them incorrect or \nmisleading. \nVarious factors, certain of which are discussed elsewhere in this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus and in the \ndocuments referred to in, or incorporated by reference into, this document, could affect the future results of \nTotalEnergies and could cause actual results to differ mate rially from those expresse d in such forward-looking \nstatements.\n \n40 DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE \nThis Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus should

party \nresponsible for the calculation of the Rate of Interest, as specified in \nthe relevant Final Terms) shall, to the extent that it is reasonably practicable, follow such guidance in order to determine SONIA for \nthe purpose of the Notes for so l ong as the SONIA is not available \nor has not been published by the authorised distributors. \n(bb) subject to Condition 4(c), where “S OFR” is specified as the relevant \nReference Rate in the applicable Final Terms, if, in respect of any \nBusiness Day, the Reference Rate is not available, such Reference \nRate shall be the SOFR for the first preceding Business Day on \nwhich the SOFR was published on the New York Fed’s Website, and \n“r” shall be interpreted accordingly. \n (cc) In the event that the Rate of Interest cannot be determined in \naccordance with the app lication of the foregoing provisions, and a \nBenchmark Event has not occurred in accordance with Condition \n4(c), the Rate of Interest shall be (i) that determined as at the last \npreceding Interest Determination Date (though substituting, where a different Margin or Maximum Rate of Interest or Minimum Rate of \nInterest is to be applied to the re levant Interest Accrual Period from \nthat which applied to the last preceding Interest Accrual Period, the Margin or Maximum Rate of Intere st or Minimum Rate of Interest \nrelating to the relevant Interest Accrual Period, in place of the \nMargin or Maximum Rate of Intere st or Minimum Rate of Interest \nrelating to that last preceding Intere st Accrual Period) or (ii) if there \nis no such preceding Interest Determination Date, the Initial Rate of \nInterest which would have been applicable to such Series of Notes for the first Interest Accrual Period had the Notes been in issue for a \nperiod equal in duration to the scheduled first Interest Accrual Period \nbut ending on (and excluding) the Interest Commencement Date (but applying the Margin and any Maximum Rate of Interest or Minimum Rate of Interest applicable to the first Interest Accrual Period). \nWhere Screen Rate Determination is specified in the applicable Final \nTerms as the manner in which the Rate of Interest is to be determined \nand the Reference Rate in respect of the Floating Rate Notes is \n \n68 specified as being SONIA or SOFR, if the relevant Series of Notes \nbecomes due and payable in accord ance with Condition 9, the final \nInterest Determination Date shall, notwithstanding any Interest Determination Date specified in the applicable Final Terms, be \ndeemed to be the date on which such Notes became due and payable \nand the Rate of Interest on such Notes shall, for so long as any such Note remains outstanding, be that determined on such date and as if \n(solely for the purpose of such interest determination) the relevant \nInterest Period had been shortened accordingly. \nAny determination, decision or election that may be made by the \nCalculation Agent (or such other qualified and independent party \nresponsible for the calculation of the Rate of Interest, as specified in \nthe relevant Final Terms) pursuant to this provision, including any \ndetermination with respect to a rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and \nany decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any \nselection, (i) will be conclusive a nd binding absent manifest error, \n(ii) will be made in the Calcula tion Agent’s (or such other qualified \nand independent party responsible for the calculation of the Rate of \nInterest, as specified in the relevant Final Terms) sole discretion, and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the documentation \nrelating to the Notes, shall become  effective without consent from \nthe holders of the Notes or any other party. \n(c) Benchmark Discontinuation :  \n (A)  \n Subject to Condition 4(c)(B) below and notwithstanding the provisions above in Condition 4(b), \nif the relevant  Issuer (in consultation with the Calcula tion Agent) determines at any time prior \nto, on or following any Interest Determination Date, a Benchmark Event occurs in relation to \nthe Original Reference Rate, the relevant  Issuer will as soon as reas onably practicable (and in \nany event prior to the next relevant Interest Determination Date) appoint (at its own cost) an \nindependent financial institution of international repute or an independent adviser of recognised \nstanding with appropriate expertise (the “ Independent Adviser ”), which, acting in good faith \nand in a commercially reasonable manner and as an independent expert in the performance of \nits duties, will advise the relevant  Issuer as to whether a substitute or successor rate is available \nfor purposes of determining the Reference Rate  on each Interest Determination Date falling on \nsuch date or thereafter that is substantially co mparable to the Original Reference Rate. If the \nIndependent Adviser determines that there is  an industry accepted successor rate, the \nIndependent Adviser will advise the relevant  Issuer accordingly. For these purposes, a rate that \nis formally recommended by a relevant central bank, reserve bank, monetary authority, a group \nof the aforesaid central banks, monetary authority or supervisory authority, or any similar institution (including any committee or working group thereof) for the currency to which the \nOriginal Reference Rate relates or any supe rvisory authority which is responsible for \nsupervising the administrator of the Original Re ference Rate will be considered an industry \naccepted successor rate. It is further specified that  if there are two or more industry successor \nrates recommended by the above-mentioned authority, institution or working groups, the \nIndependent Adviser shall determine which of th ose successor rates is most appropriate for the \npurpose of formulating its advice to the relevant Issuer, having regard to, inter alia , the \nparticular features of the relevant Notes, market  practice or relevant precedents for such type of \nNotes and the nature of the relevant Issuer. Following the foregoing advice from the Independent Adviser, the relevant  Issuer (in consultation with the In dependent Adviser) will determine a \nsubstitute or successor ra te (such rate, the “ Replacement Reference Rate ”), for purposes of \ndetermining the Reference Rate on each Interest  Determination Date falling on or after such \ndetermination but not earlier than the actual discontinuation of the Original Reference Rate. \nAdditionally, (i) the relevant  Issuer (in consultation with the Independent Adviser) will also \ndetermine changes (if any) to the business day convention, the definition of business day, the \ninterest determination date, the day count fraction, and any method for obtaining the \nReplacement Reference Rate, including any ad justment factor needed to make such \n \n69 Replacement Reference Rate comp arable to the Original Reference Rate (including any \nAdjustment Spread), in each case in a manner that  is consistent with industry-accepted practices \nfor such Replacement Reference Rate; (ii) refere nces to the Original Reference Rate in the \nConditions and the Final Terms applicable to the relevant Notes will be deemed to be references \nto the Replacement Reference Rate, including any alternative method for determining such rate \nas described in (i) above; and (iii) the relevant  Issuer will give notice as soon as reasonably \npracticable to the No teholders (in accordance with Condition 13 ( Notices )) and the Paying \nAgent(s) specifying the Replacement Reference Ra te, as well as the details described in (i) \nabove. \n The determination of the Replacement Reference Rate and the other matters referred to above \nby the relevant  Issuer (in consultation with the Independ ent Adviser, as applicable) will (in the \nabsence of manifest error) be final and binding on the Fiscal Agent, the Calculation Agent, the \nMake-whole Calculation Agents, the Quota tion Agents, the Paying Agent(s) and the \nNoteholders, unless the relevant  Issuer, acting in good faith, in a commercially reasonable \nmanner, considers at a later date that the Repl acement Reference Rate is no longer substantially \ncomparable to the Reference Ra te or does not constitute an in dustry accepted successor rate, in \nwhich case the relevant  Issuer shall re-appoint an Independent Adviser (which may or may not \nbe the same entity as the original Independent Adviser) for the purpose of advising the relevant  \nIssuer on confirming the Repl acement Reference Rate or determ ining a substitute Replacement \nReference Rate in an identical manner as described in this Condition 4(c).  \n For the avoidance of doubt, the Fiscal Agent sha ll, at the direction and expense of the relevant \nIssuer, effect such consequential amendments to the Agency Agreemen t and these Conditions \nas may be required in order to give effect to this Condition 4(c). No Noteholder consent shall be required in connection with effecting the Replacement Reference Rate or such other changes \npursuant to this Condition 4(c), including for th e execution of any documents or other steps by \nthe Paying Agent(s) (if required).  \n Notwithstanding any other provision of this Cond ition 4(c), if the relevant Issuer is unable to \nappoint an Independent Adviser or if the Independent Adviser is unable to or otherwise does not \nadvise the relevant  Issuer a Replacement Reference Rate fo r any Interest Determination Date, \nno Replacement Reference Rate or any other su ccessor, replacement or alternative benchmark \nor screen rate will be adopted and the Reference Rate for the relevant Interest Accrual Period \nwill be equal to the last Reference Rate availabl e on the Relevant Screen Page as determined by \nthe Calculation Agent. \n (B)   \nNotwithstanding the provisions above in Condition 4(b), if the Original Reference Rate is  SOFR \nand unless “Benchmark Transition Event” is speci fied as being not applicable in the Final  Terms, \nwhen any required Rate of Interest (or any co mponent part thereof) remains to be determined  \nby reference to such Original Reference Rate, then the following provisions of this Condition 4(c)(B) shall apply instead of the application of Condition 4(c)(A) above. \nIf the relevant Issuer or anothe r entity appointed by the relevant  Issuer determines on or prior to \nthe Relevant Time on the relevant Interest Determination  Date that a Benchmark Transition \nEvent and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred  with respect to the Original \nReference Rate, the Benchmark Re placement will replace such Original  Reference Rate for all \npurposes relating to the Notes in respect of all determinations on such date and  for all \ndeterminations on all subsequent dates (subject to any subsequent application of this Condition\n \n4(c)(B) with respect to such Benchmark Replacement). \nWhere this Condition 4(c)(B) applie s, if the relevant Issuer considers it may be necessary to \nmake Benchmark  Replacement Conforming Changes, the relevant  Issuer shall use its reasonable \nendeavours to appoint and  consult with an Independent Adviser, as soon as reasonably \npracticable, to advise the relevant  Issuer in  determining (A) whether such Benchmark \nReplacement Conforming Chan ges are necessary and (B)  the terms of the Benchmark \nReplacement Conforming Changes and the relevant Issuer shall, subject to  giving irrevocable \nnotice as soon as reasonably practicable to the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 13 \n(Notices )) and the Paying Agent(s), without any requirement for the consent or  approval of \n \n70 Noteholders, vary these Conditions to give effect to such Benchmark  Replacement Conforming \nChanges with effect from the da te specified in such notice. \nIf a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred, \nany determination, decision or election that may be made by the relevant Issuer or another entity \nappointed by the relevant Issuer pursuant to this Condition 4(c)(B), including any determination \nwith respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non- occurrence of an event, \ncircumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection: \n(i) will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error; (ii) will be made  in the sole discretion \nof the relevant Issuer or another entity appointed by the relevant Issuer, as applicable, acting in good faith and in a commercial and reasonable  manner; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to \nthe contrary in the documentation relating to the Notes, shall become effective without consent \nfrom the Noteholders or any other party. \n(d) Fixed/Floating Rate Notes   \nFixed/Floating Rate Notes may bear interest at a rate (i) that the relevant Issuer may elect to convert on \nthe date set out in the Final Terms from a Fixed Rate to a Floating Rate, or from a Floating Rate to a \nFixed Rate or (ii) that will automatically change from  a Fixed Rate to a Floating Rate, or from a Floating \nRate to a Fixed Rate on the date set out in the Final Terms. \n(e) Zero Coupon Notes \nWhere a Note the Interest Basis of wh ich is specified to be Zero Coupon is repayable prior to the Maturity \nDate and is not paid when due, the amount due and payable prior to the Maturity Date shall be the Early Redemption Amount of such Note. As from the Matu rity Date, the Rate of Interest for any overdue \nprincipal of such a Note shall be a rate per annum  (expressed as a percentage) equal to the Amortisation \nYield (as described in Condition 5(b)(i)). \n(f) Accrual of Interest \nInterest shall cease to accrue on each  Note on the due date for redemp tion unless, upon due presentation, \npayment is improperly withheld or refused, in which event interest shall continue to accrue (both before \nand after judgment) to the Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 7) at the Rate of Interest in the manner provided in this Condition 4. \n(g) Margin, Maximum/Minimum Rates of Interest, Instalment Amounts and Redemption \nAmounts and Rounding \n(i) If any Margin is specified in the relevant Final Terms (either (x) generally, or (y) in \nrelation to one or more Interest Accrual Periods), an adjustment shall be made to all \nRates of Interest, in the case of (x), or the Rates of Interest for the specified Interest \nAccrual Periods, in the case of (y), calculated in accordance with (b) above by adding (if a positive number) or subtracting the absolute value (if a negative number) of such Margin, subject always to the next paragraph. \n(ii) If any Maximum or Minimum Rate of Interest, Instalment Amount or Redemption \nAmount is specified in the relevant Final Terms, then any Rate of Interest, Instalment \nAmount or Redemption Amount shall be subject to such maximum or minimum, as \nthe case may be. Unless a higher rate is stated in the applicable Final Terms, the Minimum Rate of Interest shall be deemed to be zero. \n(iii) For the purposes of any calculations required pursuant to these Conditions, (x) all \npercentages resulting from such calculations shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (with halves being rounded up), \n(y) all figures shall be rounded to seven significant figures (with halves being rounded \nup) and (z) all currency amounts that fall due and payable shall be rounded to the nearest unit of such cu rrency (with halves being rounded up), save in the case of yen, \nwhich shall be rounded down to the nearest yen. For these purposes, “ unit” means the \n \n71 lowest amount of such currency that is ava ilable as legal tender in the country/ies of \nsuch currency. \n(h) Calculations \nThe amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount in respect of any Note for any Interest Accrual \nPeriod shall be equal to the product of the Rate of Interest, the Calculation Amount specified in the \nrelevant Final Terms and the Day Count Fraction for such Interest Accrual Period, unless an Interest \nAmount (or a formula for its calculation) is applicable  to such Interest Accrual Period, in which case the \namount of interest payable in respect of such Note for such period shall equal such Interest Amount (or \nbe calculated in accordance with such formula). Wh ere any Interest Period comprises two or more \nInterest Accrual Periods, the amount of interest payable in respect of such Interest Period shall be the \nsum of the Interest Amount s payable in respect of each of those In terest Accrual Periods. In respect of \nany other period for which interest is required to be calculated, the provisions above shall apply save that the Day Count Fraction shall be for the period for which interest is required to be calculated. \n(i) Determination and Publication of Rates of Interest, Interest Amo unts, Final Redemption \nAmounts, Early Redemption Amounts, Optional Redemption Amounts, Make-whole Redemption Amounts and Instalment Amounts \nThe Calculation Agent, the Make-whole Calculation Agent or the Quotation Agent, as applicable, shall, \nas soon as practicable, on such date as the Calcul ation Agent, the Make-whole Calculation Agent or the \nQuotation Agent, as applicable, may be required to calculate any rate or amount, obtain any quotation or \nmake any determination or calculation, determine su ch rate and calculate the Interest Amounts for the \nrelevant Interest Accrual Period, calculate the Final Redemption Amount, Early Redemption Amount, \nOptional Redemption Amount, Make-whole Redemption Amount or Instalment Amount, obtain such \nquotation or make such determination or calculation, as the case may be, and cause the Rate of Interest \nand the Interest Amounts for each Interest Accrual Peri od and the relevant Interest Payment Date and, if \nrequired to be calculated, the Final Redemption Amount, Early Redemption Amount, Optional \nRedemption Amount, Make-whole Redemption Amount or any Instalment Amount to be notified to the Fiscal Agent, the relevant  Issuer, each of the Paying Agents, the Noteholders, any other Calculation \nAgent appointed in respect of the Notes that is to  make a further calculation upon receipt of such \ninformation and, if the Notes are listed on a stock exchange and the rules of such exchange or other relevant authority so require, such exchange or othe r relevant authority as soon as possible after their \ndetermination but in no event later than (i) the commencement of the relevant Interest Period, if \ndetermined prior to such time, in the case of notifi cation to such exchange of a Rate of Interest and \nInterest Amount, or (ii) in all other cases, the four th Business Day after such determination. Where any \nInterest Payment Date or Interest Period Date is su bject to adjustment pursuant to Condition 4(b)(ii), the \nInterest Amounts and the Interest Payment Date so published may subsequently be amended (or \nappropriate alternative arrangemen ts made by way of adjustment) without notice in the event of an \nextension or shortening of the Interest Period. If the Notes become due and payable under Condition 9, the accrued interest and the Rate of Interest payabl e in respect of the Notes shall nevertheless continue \nto be calculated as previously in accordance with this  Condition but no publication of the Rate of Interest \nor the Interest Amount so calculated need be made. The determination of any rate or amount, the obtaining of each quotation and the making of each de termination or calculation by the Calculation \nAgent(s), the Make-whole Calculatio n Agent or the Quotation Agent, as applicable, shall (in the absence \nof manifest error) be final and binding upon all parties. \n(j) Definitions \nIn these Conditions, unless the context otherwise requires, the following defined terms shall have the \nmeanings set out below: \n“2006 ISDA Definitions ” means the 2006 ISDA Definitions published by the International Swaps and Derivatives \nAssociation, Inc. as am ended or supplemented as at the Issue Date. \n“2021 ISDA Definitions ” means the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivative Definitions published by the \nInternational Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. as amended or supplemented as at the Issue Date. \n“Adjustment Spread ” means either a spread (which may be positive or negative), or the formula or the \nmethodology for calculating a spread, in either case, which the Independent Adviser determines, in consultation \n \n72 with the relevant Issuer, and which is required to be a pplied to the substitute or successor rate to reduce or \neliminate, to the extent reasonably pr acticable in the circumstances, any econ omic prejudice or benefit (as the case \nmay be) to Noteholders as a result of the replacement of the Reference Rate, with the replacement rate and is the \nspread, formula or methodology which is formally recommended, or formally provided as an option for parties to \nadopt, in relation to the replacement of the Reference Rate , as applicable, or is in customary market usage in the \ninternational debt capital markets for transactions which reference the Reference Rate, or if no such \nrecommendation or option has been made (or made available), or the Independent Adviser determines there is no \nsuch spread, formula or methodology in customary market usage, the Independent Adviser, acting in good faith \nand in a commercially reasonable manner and as an independ ent expert in the performance of its duty, determines \nto be appropriate to reduce or eliminate, to the extent  reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic \nprejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Noteholders as a result of the replacement of the Original Reference \nRate, with the replacement rate. \n“Benchmark Event ” means, in the determination of the relevant Issuer, with respect to an Original Reference \nRate:  \n(i) the Original Reference Rate ceasin g to be published for a period of at least five (5) Business \nDays or ceasing to exist;

and \n(D) if a Second Step-up Date is specified in the relevant Final Terms, from (and including) the \nSecond Step-up Date at the Following Step-up Interest Rate set forth in the applicable Final Terms, \nand provided that each of the First Reset Interest Rate, the First Step-u p Interest Rate, if applicable, and \nthe Following Step-up Interest Rate shall never be less than zero. \nEach Interest Amount will be payable in arrear or in  advance on the date or dates in each year specified \nin the relevant Final Terms as being an Interest Payment Date, subject to Condition 4.5. The first payment of interest will be made on the First Interest Paymen t Date (as specified in the applicable Final Terms) \nfollowing the Interest Commencement Date. \nPromptly after the determination of the Reference Ra te by it or the Independent Adviser, as the case may \nbe, the Calculation Agent shall determine the Interest Rate for each Note and calculate the relevant Interest Amount. \nThe Calculation Agent will cause the Interest Rate and the relevant Interest Amount payable per Note to \nbe notified to the Issuer and the Fiscal Agent and, if required by the rules of Euronext Paris or any other \nstock exchange on which Notes are listed from time to time, to such stock exchange, and to the \nNoteholders and the Couponholders in accordance with Condition 14 ( Notices ) without undue delay, but, \nin any case, not later than on the four th Business Day after its determination. \n4.2 Calculation of the Interest Amount \nThe amount of interest (the “ Interest Amount ”) payable per Calculation Amount on each Note and on \neach Interest Payment Date will be the product as cal culated by the Calculation Agent of the Calculation \nAmount and the applicable Interest Rate, multiplied by the Day Count Fraction and rounding the resulting \nfigure, if necessary, to the nearest cen t (half a cent being rounded upwards).  \n4.3 Notifications, etc. to be final \nAll notifications, opinions, determinations, certificat es, calculations, quotations and decisions given, \nexpressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of this Condition 4 ( Interest and deferral \nof interest ), whether by the Reference Banks (or any of them), the Calculation Agent or the Independent \nAdviser, will (in the absence of wilful default, bad fa ith or manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the \nCalculation Agent, the Independent Adviser, the Fiscal Agent and all Noteholders and Couponholders. \n4.4 Calculation Agent \nThe Agency Agreement provides that the Issuer ma y at any time terminate the appointment of the \nCalculation Agent and appoint a substitute Calculation Agent provided that so long as any of the Notes \nremain outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent for the purposes of the Notes having \na specified office in a major European city. In the ev ent of the appointed office of any bank being unable \nor unwilling to continue to act as the Calculation Agent or failing duly to determine the Interest Amount \nfor any Interest Period, the Issuer shall appoint the European office of another leading bank engaged in \nthe Euro-zone or London interbank ma rket to act in its place. The Ca lculation Agent may not resign its \nduties or be removed without a successor having been appointed. \nNotice of any change of Calculation Agent or any change of specified office shall promptly be given as \nsoon as reasonably practicable to the Noteholders and th e Couponholders in accord ance with Condition \n \n97 14 (Notices ) and, so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on Euronext Paris and if the rules applicable \nto such stock exchange so require, to such stock exchange. \n4.5 Optional Interest Deferral \nInterest payments shall only be due and payable if th e Issuer so elects, in acco rdance with the provisions \nof the following paragraphs. \n(a) Optional Interest Payment \nThe Issuer may, at any time and at its sole discretio n, elect to defer all or part of the payment of \ninterest accrued on the Notes in respect of any In terest Period, except in relation to a payment \nof interest to be made on an Interest Payment Date falling on the date of redemption of the \nNotes, by giving notice of such election to the Noteholders and the Couponholders in \naccordance with paragraph (d) below.  If the Issuer makes such an election, the Issuer shall have \nno obligation to make such payment and any such non-payment or partial payment of interest shall not constitute a default of the Issuer or any other breach of obligations under the Notes. \nAny interest in respect of the Notes which has not been paid in accordance with this paragraph \nwill be deferred and shall constitute “ Arrears of Interest ” and shall be payable as provided \nbelow. \n(b) Payment of Arrears of Interest \nArrears of Interest (together with any Additional Interest Amount (as defined below)) may at \nthe option of the Issuer be paid, in whole or in part, at any time, provid ed that all Arrears of \nInterest (together with the corresponding Additi onal Interest Amounts) in respect of all Notes \nfor the time being outstanding shall become due and payable in whole, but not in part, on the date which is the earliest of: \n(A) the tenth (10\nth) Business Days following the occurrence of a Mandatory \nPayment Event;

or \n(D) the date upon which a judgment is made for the judicial liquidation \n(liquidation judiciaire ) of the Issuer, or in the even t of a transfer of the whole \nof the business ( cession totale de l’entreprise ) of the Issuer subsequent to the \nopening of a judicial recovery ( redressement judiciaire ) or in the event of the \nvoluntary dissolution of the Issuer, or in the event the Issuer is liquidated for \nany other reason (and in all cases listed above, other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger or other reorganisation outside the \ncontext of an insolvency and where the resulting entity assumes the \nobligations of the Issuer under the Notes). \nEach amount of Arrears of Interest shall bear interest as if it constituted the principal of the \nNotes at a rate which corresponds to the rate of interest from time to time applicable to the Notes \n(the “ Arrears Interest Rate ”) and the amount of such interest (the “ Additional Interest \nAmount ”) with respect to Arrears of Interest shall be due and payable pursuant to this paragraph \n(b) and shall be calculated by the Calculation Ag ent applying the Arrears Interest Rate to the \namount of the Arrears of Interest and otherwise mutatis mutandis  as provided in the foregoing \nprovisions of this Condition.  \nThe Additional Interest Amount accrued up to any Interest Payment Date shall be added in \naccordance with and to the extent permitted by ap plicable law to the amount of Arrears of \nInterest remaining unpaid on such Interest Paym ent Date so that it will itself become Arrears of \nInterest, for the purpose only of  calculating the Additional Intere st Amount accruing thereafter. \n \n98 For the purposes of this Condition, unless the context otherwise requires, the following defined term \nshall have the meaning set out below: \n“Mandatory Payment Event ” means that: \n(i) a dividend (either interim or final), or any other distribution or payment (whether or not in cash) \nwas validly resolved on, declared, paid or made in respect of any Junior  Securities or Parity \nSecurities, except where such dividend, distribution or payment was contractually required to \nbe declared, paid or made under the terms of such  Junior Securities or Parity Securities; or  \n(ii) the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer has repurchased, purchased, redeemed or otherwise \nacquired any Junior Securities, except where (a ) such repurchase, purchase, redemption or \nacquisition was undertaken pursuant to any sh are buyback programme in force and duly \napproved by its shareholders’ general meeting in connection with the satisfaction by the Issuer \nor any Subsidiary of the Issuer of its respective obligations under any employee shareholding \nprogrammes (including but not limited to any share purchase option plan, free share allocation plan, shares sold to employees through the Is suer savings funds or share capital increase) \nreserved for officers and/or employees of th e Issuer’s group, or any associated hedging \ntransaction, (b) such repurcha se, purchase, redemption or acquisition was undertaken pursuant \nto the hedging of convertible securities or hedgi ng of other equity-linked securities, (c) such \nrepurchase, purchase, redemption or acquisition is contractually required to be made under the \nterms of such Junior Securities or (d) such re purchase, purchase, rede mption or acquisition is \nmade in connection with the satisfaction by the Issuer of its obligations under any existing or \nfuture liquidity agreement ( contrat de liquidité ) managed by an investment services provider to \nrepurchase its share capital from such investment services provider; or \n(iii) the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer has repurchased, purchased, redeemed or otherwise \nacquired any Parity Securities, except where (a) such repurchase, purchase, redemption or \nacquisition is contractually required to be made u nder the terms of such Pa rity Securities or (b) \nsuch repurchase, purchase, redemption or acquisitio n is effected as a public tender offer or \npublic exchange offer at a purchase price per security which is below its par value. \nprovided  that a Mandatory Payment Event shall not occur pursuant to paragraph (i) above in \nrespect of any pro rata payment of deferred or arrears of interest on any Parity Securities which \nis made simultaneously with a pro rata payment of any Arrears of Interest and/or Additional \nInterest Amounts, provided  further such pro rata payment of deferred or arrears of interest on \na Parity Security is not proportionately more than  the pro rata settlement of any such Arrears of \nInterest and/or Additional Interest Amounts. \n \n(c) Optional Partial Payment of Arrears of Inte rest and Additional Interest Amounts:  \nIf amounts in respect of Arrears of Interest an d Additional Interest Amounts are paid in part: \n(A) all unpaid amounts of Arrears of Interest shall be payable before any \nAdditional Interest Amounts; \n(B) Arrears of Interest accrued for any pe riod shall not be payable until full \npayment has been made of all Arrears of Interest that have accrued during any earlier period and the order of payment of Additional Interest Amounts shall \nfollow that of the Arrears of Interest to which they relate; and \n(C) the amount of Arrears of Interest or Additional Interest Amounts payable in \nrespect of any of the Notes in respect of any period, shall be pro rata to the \ntotal amount of all unpaid Arrears of Interest or, as the case may be, Additional Interest Amounts accrued on the Notes in respect of that period to the date of payment. \n(d) Notice of Deferral and Paymen t of Arrears of Interests \n \n99 Notice of (i) deferral of any interest under the Notes on any Interest Payment Date and (ii) any \ndate upon which amounts in respect of Arrears of Interest and/or Additional Interest Amounts \nshall become due and payable shall be given to the Noteholders and the Couponholders in accordance with Condition 14 ( Notices ), and the Fiscal Agent and the Calculation Agent at least \nfive (5) Business Days in Paris and in London, but no more than thirty (30) Business Days in \nParis and in London, prior to such Interest Payment Date or date. So long as the Notes are admitted to trading on Euronext Paris and the rules applicable to such stock exchange so require, \nnotice of any such deferral shall also be given as soon as reason ably practicable to such stock \nexchange. \n4.6 Benchmark Discontinuation \nIf the Issuer determines at any time prior to, on or  following any Reset Interest Determination Date, a \nMid-Swap Benchmark Event occurs in relation to the Original Mid-Swap Rate, the Issuer will as soon \nas reasonably practicable (and in any event prior to the next relevant Reset Interest Determination Date) \nappoint (at its own cost) an independent financial institution of international repute or an independent \nadviser of recognised standing with appropriate expertise (the “ Independent Adviser ”), which, acting \nin good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner and as an independent expert in the performance of its duties, will advise the Issuer  as to whether a substitute or succes sor rate is available for purposes \nof determining the Mid-Swap Rate on each Reset Interest Determination Date falling on such date or \nthereafter that is substantially comparable to the Original Mid-Swap Rate. If the Independent Adviser \ndetermines that there is an industry accepted succes sor rate, the Independent Adviser will advise the \nIssuer accordingly. For these purpos es, a rate that is formally recommended by a relevant central bank, \nreserve bank, monetary authority, a group of the aforesaid central banks, monetary authority or supervisory authority, or any similar institution (inc luding any committee or working group thereof) for \nthe currency to which the Original Mid-Swap Rate  relates or any supervisory authority which is \nresponsible for supervising the administrator of th e Original Mid-Swap Rate  will be considered an \nindustry accepted successor rate. It is further specified that if ther e are two or more industry successor \nrates recommended by the above-mentioned authority, institution or working groups, the Independent \nAdviser shall determine which of those successor rates is most appropriate for the purpose of formulating \nits advice to the Issuer, having regard to, inter alia , the particular features of the relevant Notes, market \npractice or relevant precedents for such type of Notes and the nature of the Issuer. Following the \nforegoing advice from the Independent Adviser, the Issuer (in consultation with the Independent Adviser) \nwill determine a substitute or successor rate (such rate, the “ Replacement Mid-Swap Rate ”), for \npurposes of determining the Mid-Swap Rate on each Re set Interest Determination Date falling on or after \nsuch determination but not earlier than the actual discontinuation of the Original Mid-Swap Rate. \nAdditionally, (i) the Issuer (in consultation with th e Independent Adviser) will also determine changes \n(if any) to the business day convention, the definition of business day, the interest determination date, \nthe day count fraction, and any method for obtaini ng the Replacement Mid-Swap Rate, including any \nadjustment factor needed to make such Replacemen t Mid-Swap Rate comparab le to the Original Mid-\nSwap Rate (including any Mid-Swap Adjustment Spread ), in each case in a manner that is consistent \nwith industry-accepted pract ices for such Replacement Mid-Swap Rate ; (ii) references to the Original \nMid-Swap Rate in the Conditions and the Final Terms applicable to the relevant Notes will be deemed \nto be references to the Replacement Mid-Swap Ra te, including any alternative method for determining \nsuch rate as described in (i) above; and (iii) the Is suer will give notice as soon as reasonably practicable \nto the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 14 ( Notices )) and the Paying Agent(s) specifying the \nReplacement Mid-Swap Rate, as well as the details described in (i) above. \nThe determination of the Replacement Mid-Swap Rate and the other matters referred to above by the \nIssuer (in consultation with the Independent Adviser, as  applicable) will (in the absence of manifest error) \nbe final and binding on the Fiscal Agent, the Calculation Agent, the Make-whole Calculation Agents, the Quotation Agents, the Paying Agent(s) and the Noteho lders, unless the Issuer, acting in good faith, in a \ncommercially reasonable manner, considers at a late r date that the Replacement Mid-Swap Rate is no \nlonger substantially comparable to the Original Mid-Swap Rate or does not constitute an industry \naccepted successor rate, in which case the Issuer shall re-appoint an Independent  Adviser (which may or \nmay not be the same entity as the original Independ ent Adviser) for the purpose of advising the Issuer \non confirming the Replacement Mid-Swap Rate or de termining a substitute Re placement Mid-Swap Rate \nin an identical manner as described in this Condition 4.6.  \n \n100 For the avoidance of doubt, the Fiscal Agent shall, at the direction and expense of the Issuer, effect such \nconsequential amendments to the Agency Agreement and these Conditions as may be required in order \nto give effect to this Condition 4.6. No Noteholder co nsent shall be required in connection with effecting \nthe Replacement Mid-Swap Rate or such other change s pursuant to this Conditio n 4.6, including for the \nexecution of any documents or other steps by the Paying Agent(s) (if required).  \nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Cond ition 4.6, no Replacement Mid-Swap Rate will be \nadopted, nor will the applicable Adjustment Spread be applied, nor will any other related adjustments \nand/or amendments to the Terms and Conditions of the Notes be made, if and to the extent that, in the \ndetermination of the Issuer, the same could reasonab ly be expected to (i) result in a reduction of the \namount of “equity credit” assigned to the Notes by  any Rating Agency when compared to the “equity \ncredit” assigned to the Notes immediately prior to the occurrence of the relevant Mid-Swap Benchmark \nEvent from such Rating Agency or (ii) otherwise prej udice the eligibility of the Notes for “equity credit” \nfrom any Rating Agency. \nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Condition 4.6, if the Issuer is unable to appoint an \nIndependent Adviser or if the Independent Adviser is unable to or otherwise does not advise the Issuer a \nReplacement Mid-Swap Rate for any Reset Interest  Determination Date, no Replacement Mid-Swap \nRate or any other successor, replacement or alternativ e benchmark or screen rate will be adopted and the \nMid-Swap Rate for the relevant Interest Accrual Period  will be equal to the last Mid-Swap Rate available \non the Relevant Screen Page as determined by the Calculation Agent. \n4.7 Business Day Convention \nIf any date referred to in these Conditions that is speci fied to be subject to adjustment in accordance with \na Business Day Convention would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, then, if the Business Day Convention specified in the relevant Final Terms is: (A) the Following Business Day Convention, \nsuch date shall be postponed to the next calendar day that is a Business Day; (B) the Modified Following \nBusiness Day Convention, such date shall be postponed to the next calendar day that is a Business Day unless it would thereby fall into the next calendar month, in which event such date shall be brought \nforward to the immediately precedi ng Business Day; or (C) the Preceding Business Day Convention, \nsuch date shall be brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day. \n4.8 Definitions \nIn these Conditions, unless the context otherwise requires, the following defined terms shall have the \nmeanings set out below: \n“Benchmark Gilt ” means, in relation to a Reset Period, such United Kingdom government security \ncustomarily used at the time of selection in the pricin g of new issues with a similar tenor having an actual \nor interpolated maturity date on or about the last da y of such Reset Period as the Issuer (on the advice of \nan investment bank of international repute) may determine to be appropriate following any guidance published by the International Capital Markets Association at the relevant time (if any). \n“Benchmark Gilt Dealing Day ” means a day on which the London Stock Exchange plc (or such other \nmarket on which the Benchmark Gilt is at the relevant  time admitted to trading) is ordinarily open for \nthe trading of securities. \n“Benchmark Gilt Rate ” means the Gross Redemption Yield on  a semi-annual compounding basis \n(converted to an annualised yield and rounded up (i f necessary) to four decimal places) of the Benchmark \nGilt in respect of that Reset Period, with the price of the Benchmark Gilt for the purpose of determining \nthe Gross Redemption Yield being the arithmetic averag e (rounded up (if necessary ) to the nearest 0.001 \nper cent. (0.0005 per cent. being rounded upwards)) of  the bid and offered prices  of such Benchmark Gilt \nquoted by the Gilt Reference Banks at 11.00 a.m. (London time) on the relevant Reset Determination \nDate on a dealing basis for settlement on the next following Benchmark Gilt Dealing Day in London, or \nsuch basis as is customarily used at such time. Such quotations shall be obtained by or on behalf of the Issuer and provided to the Determination Agent. If at least four quotations are provided, the Benchmark \nGilt Rate will be determined by reference to the ro unded arithmetic mean of the quotations provided, \neliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest).

Depositing the Global \nNotes with the Common Safekeeper do es not necessarily mean that the No tes will be recognised as eligible \ncollateral for Eurosystem monetary polic y and intra-day credit operations by the Eurosystem either upon issue, or \nat any or all times during their life. Such recognition w ill depend upon satisfaction of the Eurosystem eligibility \ncriteria. \nGlobal Notes which are issued in CGN form may be delivered  on or prior to the original issue date of the Tranche \nto a depositary or a Common Depositary. \nIf the Global Note is a CGN, upon the initial deposit of a Global Note with the depositary or Common Depositary \nfor Euroclear and Clearstr eam, or such other clearing system as the rele vant Issuer, relevant Dealer or Agent shall \nagree, the relevant clearing system Euroclear or Clearstr eam will credit each subscriber with a nominal amount of \nNotes equal to the nominal amount thereof for which it has subscribed and paid. If the Global Note is an NGN, \nthe nominal amount of the Notes shall be the aggregat e amount from time to time entered in the records of \nEuroclear or Clearstream. The records of  such clearing system shall be conclu sive evidence of the nominal amount \nof Notes represented by the Global No te and a statement issued by such clearing system at any time shall be \nconclusive evidence of the records of the relevant clearing system at that time. \nNotes that are initially depos ited with the Common Depositary may also be  credited to the accounts of subscribers \nwith (if indicated in the relevant Final Terms) other clearing systems through direct or indirect accounts with \nEuroclear and Clearstream held by such other clearing sy stems. Conversely, Notes that are initially deposited with \nany other clearing system may similarly be credited to th e accounts of subscribers with  Euroclear, Clearstream or \nother clearing systems. \nRelationship of Accounthold ers with Clearing Systems \nEach of the persons shown in the records of Euroclear, Clea rstream or any other clearing  system as the holder of \na Note represented by a Global Note must look solely to  Euroclear, Clearstream or such clearing system (as the \ncase may be) for such holder’s share of each payment made by the relevant Issuer to the bearer of such Global \nNote and in relation to all other rights arising under th e Global Notes, subject to and in accordance with the \nrespective rules and procedures of Eu roclear, Clearstream, or such cleari ng system (as the case may be). Such \npersons shall have no claim directly against the relevant Issuer in respect of payments due on the Notes for so \nlong as the Notes are represented by such Global Note  and such obligations of th e relevant Issuer will be \ndischarged by payment to the bearer of such Gl obal Note in respect of  each amount so paid. \nExchange Temporary Global Notes \nEach Temporary Global Note will be exchangeable, free of charge to the holder, on or after its Exchange Date: \n(i) where the Notes represented by the Temporary Global Note have been issued in an integral multiple of \nthe Specified Denomination, if the relevant Final Terms indicates that such Global Note is issued in compliance \nwith the C Rules or in a transaction to  which TEFRA is not applicable, in whole, but not in part, for the Definitive \nNotes defined and described below; and \n(ii) otherwise, in whole or in part upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership in the form set out \nin the Agency Agreement for interests in a Permanent Global  Note or, if so provided in the relevant Final Terms, \nfor Definitive Notes. \nPermanent Global Notes Each Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable, free of ch arge to the holder, on or after its Exchange Date in \nwhole but not, except as provided under “— Partial Exchange of Permanent Global Notes ”, in part for Definitive \nNotes: \n \n122 (i) if the Permanent Global Note is held on behalf of  Euroclear or Clearstream or any other clearing system \n(an “ Alternative Clearing System ”) and any such clearing system is closed  for business for a continuous period \nof 14 calendar days (other than by reason of holidays, statutory or otherwise) or announces an intention permanently to cease business or in fact does so; or \n(ii) if principal in respect of any No tes is not paid when due, by the holder giving notice to the Fiscal Agent \nof its election for such exchange. \nIn the event that a Global Note is exchanged for Defi nitive Notes, such Definitive Notes shall be issued in \nSpecified Denomination(s) only. \nA Noteholder who holds a pr incipal amount of less than the minimum Specified Denomination will not receive a \nDefinitive Note in respect of such holding and would need to purchase a principal amount of Notes such that it holds an amount equal to one or more Specified Denominations. \nPartial Exchange of Permanent Global Notes For so long as a Permanent Global Note is held on behalf of a clearing system and the ru les of that clearing system \npermit, such Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable in part on one or more occasions for Definitive Notes \nif principal in respect of any Notes is not paid when due. \nDelivery of Notes \nIf the Global Note is a CGN, on or after any due date for exchange, the holder of a Global Note may surrender \nsuch Global Note or, in the case of a partial exchange, pr esent it for endorsement to or to the order of the Fiscal \nAgent. In exchange for any Global Note, or the part thereof to be exchanged, the relevant Issuer will (i) in the case \nof a Temporary Global Note exchangeable for a Permanent Global Note, deliver, or procure the delivery of, a \nPermanent Global Note in an aggregate nominal amount equal to that of the whole or that part of a Temporary \nGlobal Note that is being exchanged or, in the case of a subsequent exchange, endorse, or procure the endorsement of, a Permanent Global Note to reflect such exchange or  (ii) in the case of a Gl obal Note exchangeable for \nDefinitive Notes, deliver, or procure the delivery of, an  equal aggregate nominal amount of duly executed and \nauthenticated Definitive Notes. If the Global Note is a NGN,  the relevant Issuer will procure that details of such \nexchange be entered pro rata  in the records of the relevant clearing system. In this Debt Issuance Programme \nProspectus, “ Definitive Notes ” means, in relation to any Global Note, the definitive Notes for which such Global \nNote may be exchanged (if appropriate,  having attached to them all Coupons and Receipts in respect of interest \nor Instalment Amounts that have not already been paid on the Global Note and a Talon). Definitive Notes will be \nsecurity printed in accordance with any applicable legal and stock exchange requirements in or substantially in \nthe form set out in the Schedules to the Agency Agreement. On exchange in  full of each Permanent Global Note, \nthe relevant Issuer will, if the holder so requests, procur e that it is cancelled and returned to the holder together \nwith the relevant Definitive Notes. \nExchange Date \n“Exchange Date ” means, in relation to a Temporary Global Note, the day falling after the expiry of 40 calendar \ndays after its issue date and, in re lation to a Permanent Global Note, a day falling not less than 60 calendar days, \nor in the case of failure to pay principal in respect of any Notes when due 30 calendar days, after that on which the notice requiring exchange is given and on which banks are open for business in the city in which the specified \noffice of the Fiscal Agent is located an d in the city in which the relevant cl earing system is lo cated. In the event \nthat a further Tranche of Notes is issued in respect of any Series of Notes pursuant to Condition 13 of the Terms \nand Conditions of the Senior Notes and Condition 12 of the Terms and Conditions of the Deeply Subordinated \nNotes which is to be consolidated with one or more pr eviously issued Tranches of such Series prior to the \nExchange Date relating to the Temporary Global Note re presenting the most recently previously issued Tranche \nof such Series, such Exchange Date may be extended until the Exchange Date with respect to such further Tranche \nprovided that in no event shall such first-mentioned Exchange Date be extended beyond the date which is five \ncalendar days prior to the first Interest Payment Date (i f any) falling after such first-mentioned Exchange Date. \nAmendment to Conditions \nThe Temporary Global Notes and Permanent Global Notes contain provisions that apply to the Notes that they \nrepresent, some of which differ from the terms and conditions of the Notes se t out in this Debt Issuance Programme \nProspectus. The following is a summary of those provisions: \n \n123 Payments \nNo payment falling due after the Exchange Date will be made on any Global Note unless exchange for an interest \nin a Permanent Global Note or for Definitive Notes is impr operly withheld or refused. Payments on any Temporary \nGlobal Note issued in compliance with the D Rules be fore the Exchange Date will only be made against \npresentation of certification as to non-U.S. beneficial owne rship in the form set out in the Agency Agreement. All \npayments in respect of Notes represented by a Global No te in CGN form will be made against presentation for \nendorsement and, if no further payment falls to be made in  respect of the Notes, surrender of that Global Note to \nor to the order of the Fiscal Agent or such other Paying Agent as shall have been notified to the Noteholders for such purpose. If the Global Note is a CGN, a record of each payment so made will be endorsed on each Global \nNote, which endorsement will be prima f acie evidence that such payment has been made in respect of the Notes. \nIf the Global Note is an NGN, the rele vant Issuer shall procure that details of each such payment shall be entered \npro rata  in the records of the relevant clearing system and, in the case of payments of principal, the nominal \namount of the Notes recorded in the records of the rele vant clearing system and represented by the Global Note \nwill be reduced accordingly. Payments under the NGN will be made to its holder. Each payment so made will \ndischarge the relevant Issuer’s obligations in respect thereof. Any failure to make the entries in the records of the \nrelevant clearing system shall not affect such discharge.  For the purpose of any payments made in respect of a \nGlobal Note, the relevant place of presentation shall be di sregarded in the definition of “business day” set out in \nthe Conditions. \nPrescription Claims against the relevant Issuer in respect of Notes that are represented by a Permanent Global Note will become \nvoid unless it is presented for payment within a period of 10 years (in the case of principal) and five years (in the \ncase of interest) from the appropriate Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 8 of the Senior Notes and Condition \n11 of the Deeply Subordinated Notes). \nMeetings \nThe holder of a Permanent Global Note shall (unless such  Permanent Global Note represents only one Note) be \ntreated as being two persons for the purposes of any quorum requirements of a meeting of Noteholders and, at any \nsuch meeting, as having one vote in respect of each integral currency unit of the Specified Currency of the Notes. \nCancellation \nCancellation of any Note represented by a Permanent Gl obal Note that is required by the Conditions to be \ncancelled (other than upon its redemption) will be effected by a reduction in the nominal amount of the relevant \nPermanent Global Note. \nPurchase Notes represented by a Permanent Global Note may only be purchased by the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor, in \nrespect of Notes issued by TotalEnergies Capital or Tota lEnergies Capital Internationa l or any of their respective \nsubsidiaries if they are purchased togeth er with the rights to receive all future  payments of interest and Instalment \nAmounts (if any) thereon. \nIssuer’s Option Any option of the relevant Issuer provided for in the Conditions of any Notes while such Notes are represented \nby a Permanent Global Note shall be exercised by the rele vant Issuer giving notice to the Noteholders within the \ntime limits set out in and containing the information requ ired by the Conditions, except  that the notice shall not \nbe required to contain the serial numbers of Notes drawn in the case of a partial exercise of an option and accordingly no drawing of Notes shall be required. In th e event that any option of the relevant Issuer is exercised \nin respect of some but not all of the Notes of any Series , the rights of accountholders  with a clearing system in \nrespect of the Notes will be governed by the standard proc edures of Euroclear, Clearstream (to be reflected in the \nrecords of Euroclear and Clearstream as  either a pool factor or a reduction in nominal amount, at their discretion) \nor any other clearing syst em (as the case may be). \nNoteholders’ Options Any option of the Noteholders provided for in the Conditio ns of any Notes while such Notes are represented by a \nPermanent Global Note may be exercised by the holder of the Permanent Global Note giving notice to the Fiscal \n \n124 Agent within the time limits relating to the deposit of Notes with a Paying Agent set out in the Conditions \nsubstantially in the form of the notice available from any Paying Agent, except that the notice shall not be required \nto contain the serial numbers of the Notes in respect of which the option has been exercised, and stating the nominal amount of Notes in respect of which the option is  exercised and at the same time, where the Permanent \nGlobal Note is a CGN, presenting the Permanent Global Note  to the Fiscal Agent, or to a Paying Agent acting on \nbehalf of the Fiscal Agent, for notatio n. Where the Global Note is an NGN, th e relevant Issuer shall procure that \ndetails of such exerci se shall be entered pro rata  in the records of the relevant clearing system and the nominal \namount of the Notes recorded in those records will be reduced accordingly. \nNGN Nominal Amount Where the Global Note is an NGN, the relevant Issuer shall procure that any exchange, payment, cancellation, \nexercise of any option or any right under the Notes, as the case may be, in addition to the circumstances set out \nabove shall be entered in the records of the relevant clearing systems and upon any such entry being made, in respect of payments of principal, the nominal amount of  the Notes represented by su ch Global Note shall be \nadjusted accordingly. \nEvents of Default and Enforcement Events Each Global Note provides that the holder may cause such Global Note, or a portion of it, to become due and \nrepayable in the circumstances described in Condition 9 of the Senior Notes and Condition 8 of the Deeply \nSubordinated Notes by stating in the no tice to the Fiscal Agent the nominal am ount of such Global Note that is \nbecoming due and repayable. If principal in respect of any Note is not paid when due, the holder of a Global Note may elect for direct enforcement rights against the rele vant Issuer and the Guaran tor under the terms of an \nAmended and Restated Deed of Covenant executed as a deed by the relevant Issuer and the Guarantor on or about \n10 September 2024 (as amended or supplemented from time to time) to come into effect in relation to the whole \nor a part of such Global Note in favour of the persons/entitled to such part of such Global Note as accountholders \nwith a clearing system. Following any such acquisition of direct rights, the Global Note will become void as to \nthe specified portion. \nNotices \nSo long as any Notes are represented by a Global Note and su ch Global Note is held on behalf of a clearing system, \nnotices to the holders of Notes of that Series may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to that clearing system \nfor communication by it to entitled account holders or by delivery of the relevant  notice to the holder of the Global \nNote, except that so long as the Notes are listed on Euronext Paris or on any other stock exchange, in accordance with the rules of such Stock Exchange from time to time. \nElectronic Consent and Written Resolution While any Global Note is held on behalf of any nominee for a clearing system, then: \n(a) approval of a resolution proposed by the relevant Issuer given by way of electronic consents \ncommunicated through the electronic communications systems of the relevant clearing system(s) in accordance \nwith their operating rules and procedures by or on behalf of the holders of not less than 75 per cent. in nominal \namount of the Notes outstanding (an “ Electronic Consent ” as defined in the Agency Agreement) shall, for all \npurposes (including matters that would otherwise require an Extraordinary Resolution to be passed at a meeting \nfor which the Special Quorum was satisfi ed), take effect as an Extraordinar y Resolution passed at a meeting of \nNoteholders duly convened and held, and shall be binding on all Noteholders and holders of Coupons, Talons and Receipts whether or not they particip ated in such Electronic Consent; and \n(b) where Electronic Consent is not being sought, for the purpose of determining whether a Written \nResolution (as defined in the Agency Agreement) has been validly passed, the relevant Issuer shall be entitled to \nrely on consent or instructions given in writing directly to the relevant Issuer by accountholders in the clearing \nsystem with entitlements to such Global Note or, where the accountholders hold any such entitlement on behalf \nof another person, on written consent from or written in struction by the person for whom such entitlement is \nultimately beneficially held, whether such beneficiary hold s directly with the accountholder or via one or more \nintermediaries and provided that, in each case, the releva nt Issuer obtained commercially reasonable evidence to \nascertain the validity of such holding and have taken reasonable steps to ensure that such holding does not alter \nfollowing the giving of such consent or instruction and pr ior to the effecting of such amendment. Any resolution \npassed in such manner shall be binding on all Noteholders and Couponholders, even if the relevant consent or \n \n125 instruction proves to be defective. As used in this paragraph, “ commercially reasonable evidence ” includes any \ncertificate or other document issued by Euroclear, Clearstream or any other relevant clearing system, or issued by \nan accountholder of them or an intermediary in a holding chain, in relation to the holding of interests in the Notes.

Any such certificate or other document may comp rise any form of statement or print out of electronic \nrecords provided by the relevant clear ing system (including Euroclear’s EU CLID or Clearstream’s CreationOnline \nsystem) in accordance with its usual pro cedures and in which the accountholder of a particular principal or nominal \namount of the Notes is clearly identified together with th e amount of such holding. The relevant Issuer shall not \nbe liable to any person by reason of having accepted as  valid or not having rejected any certificate or other \ndocument to such effect purporting to be issued by any such person and subsequently found to be forged or not authentic. \n \n126 USE OF PROCEEDS \nThe net proceeds from the issue of any Notes will be used to finance the general corporate purposes of the relevant \nIssuer. If in respect of any particular issue of Notes, ther e is a particular identified use of proceeds, this will be \nstated in the relevant Final Terms. \nIf Redemption following an Acquisition Event is specified as  applicable in the relevant Final Terms, the use of \nproceeds for acquisition consideration, dir ectly or indirectly, in whole or in part, and related fees will be stated in \nthe applicable Final Terms. The Final Terms will also stat e the potential use for general corporate purposes if the \nAcquisition Event occurs but the relevant Issuer elects not to use the Redemption following an Acquisition Event. \n \n127 DESCRIPTION OF TOTALENERGIES \nFor a description of the TotalEnergies, see pages 6 to 9, 10 to 11 and 70 to 127 of the TotalEnergies 2023 URD \nincorporated by reference into this Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus. \nHistory and development TotalEnergies SE is a French European company ( Societas Europaea  or SE) originally incorporated on 28 March \n1924 as a société anonyme  (limited company) which converted into a European company on 16 July 2020. Its \ncorporate existence is thro ugh 28 March 2119, unless othe rwise extended in  accordance with applicable law. \nTotalEnergies SE’s history started in 1924 with the creation of the Compagnie française des Pétroles (CFP), \nwhich began its oil production activities in the Middle East  at this time. Over the years, TotalEnergies SE has \ndiversified its activities and opened sites around the world by positioning itself in the gas, refining and \npetrochemical segments and the distribution of petroleum products, solar power, sustainable biofuels and \nelectricity. In early 1999, the company took over PetroFina S.A. and in early 2000 it took over Elf Aquitaine. \nSince the repeal in 2002 of  the decree of 13 December 1993  that established a golden share of Elf Aquitaine held \nby the French government, there are no longer any agreements or regulatory provisions governing shareholding relationships between TotalEnergies SE and the French government. \nWith a presence in 120 countries, To talEnergies SE is a broad energy comp any that produces and markets fuels, \nnatural gas and electricity. TotalEnergies’ model of value creation is based on integration across the energy value \nchain, from exploration and production of oil, gas and electricity to energy distribution to the end customer, and including refining, liquefaction, petrochemicals, trading, and energy transportation and storage. As of 31 \nDecember 2023, TotalEnergies’ organiza tion is centred around five business segments: Exploration & Production, \nIntegrated LNG, Integrated Power, Refini ng & Chemicals and Marketing & Services. \nThe company’s corporate name is TotalEnergies SE, effective as of 28 May 2021 upon the adoption of a resolution \nat the annual general meeting of sh areholders to change the name from  TOTAL SE to TotalEnergies SE.  \nTotalEnergies SE’s registered office is 2, place J ean Millier, La Défense 6, 92400 Courbevoie, France. \nIts telephone number is +33 1 47 44 45 46 and the website address is www.totalenergies.com . \nTotalEnergies SE is registered in France at the Nanterre Trade Register under the registration number 542 051 \n180.  \nStrategy TotalEnergies’ raison d’être is to supply to as many people as possi ble a more affordable, more available and \ncleaner energy. As a supporting component of society’ s evolutions, energy is a fundamental resource for \neconomic, social and human developmen t, which currently faces a twofold ch allenge: satisfying the energy needs \nof an ever-growing world population while reducing global warming. TotalEnergies’ raison d’être  is rooted in \nthat challenge. TotalEnergies’ intention in becoming a broad energy company is to help meet that challenge in a responsible way. \nTotalEnergies’ strategy consists in transforming itself into a broad energy company by profitably growing its \nenergy production, particularly from liquefied natural gas and electricity, the two fastest growing energy markets, \nto create long-term va lue for shareholders. \nIn particular, TotalEnergies’ strategy calls for: \n– expanding its presence across the value chain for natural gas, renewable gas and hydrogen; \n– pursuing further growth in the renewables market, expanding its power generation and distribution \ncapacity alike; \n– focusing on the most resilient oil projects, meaning those with the lowest breakeven point, and \nprioritizing value over volume while ensuring that its  capex allocation is consistent with its climate \nambition, as well as adapting refining capacity and sa les to changing demand, particularly in Europe, and \nincreasing its biofuels production and sales; and \n \n128 – investing in two major carbon sink solutions: natural carbon sinks and carbon capture and storage (CCS), \nas well as R&D programmes to deve lop negative emissions technologies. \nShare capital \nShare capital as of 30 June 2024 \n€5,994,199,152.50 consisting of 2,397,679,661 fully paid ordinary shares with a par value of €2.50 per share \n(including 87,791,389 treasury shares). \nFeatures of the shares \nThere is only one class of shares, par va lue €2.50.

This new transaction will allow TotalEnergies to capitalize on the ongoing liberalization of the \nIndian electricity market. \nThis will strengthen TotalEnergies’ strategic alliance w ith AGEL, allowing it to support the company in becoming \na global renewable leader as it targets 50 GW of renewa ble power capacity by 2030. AGEL already operates over \n11 GW of solar and wind capacity in India. \nAGEL will contribute to the joint venture with assets an d TotalEnergies will provide an equity investment of \n$444m to support their development. The signing and comp letion of the transaction is subject to the approval of \nAGEL’s shareholders and satisfaction of  customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory \napprovals. \nKhavda: the world’s largest renewable energy plant  \nAGEL (19.75% owned by TotalEnergies), is developing the world’s largest renewable energy site in the Khavda \nregion (Gujarat). Spanning over 538 km²,  five times the size of Paris, the site will boast solar and wind capacity \nof 30 GW. Of this, 2 GW has already been operationa lized by AGEL. Once completed, Khavda will generate \nenough electricity to power the equiva lent of 16 million homes in India. \nUnited States: TotalEnergies Invest s in Sustainable Forestry Operatio ns to Preserve Sustainable Carbon \nSinks \nOn 30 August 2024, TotalEnergies has signed a $100 m illion agreement with Anew C limate, a North American \nleader in climate solutions, and Auro ra Sustainable Lands, a carbon-stewardship company and forest landowner \nin the U.S. to deploy their projects aimed at protecting productive forests from heavy timber harvesting, advancing conversion to sustainable management practices, and en hancing their ability to store more carbon from the \natmosphere. The investment supports Improved Forest Management (IFM) practices across a portfolio of 20 \ncarbon projects, covering 300,000 hectares  in 10 states across th e U.S. (Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, \nMichigan, Minnesota, New York, Virginia, West Virginia , and Wisconsin). Anew Clim ate and Aurora Sustainable \nLands will provide operational oversight to ensure the ca rbon projects meet the highest standards of additionality \nand durability. \nThe environmental benefits expected from this improved forest management include the preservation of natural \ncarbon sinks by reducing timber harvesting, as well as water and soil quality improvement, biodiversity protection \nand natural habitat conservation. The carbon credits ge nerated will be acquired by TotalEnergies and retired \nbeyond 2030. After prioritizing emission avoidance an d reduction, the Company will use these credits to \nvoluntarily offset part of its remaining direct Scope 1 & 2 emissions. \nTotalEnergies supports the U.S government  Voluntary Carbon Markets Principles  \nTotalEnergies welcomes the Voluntary Carbon Markets Joint Policy Statement and Principles guide issued by \nU.S. government on 28 May 2024. The Company’s actions in nature-based solutions are aligned with these Principles, particularly those focused on integr ity, transparency and environmental protection. \n“We are thrilled to partner with such experienced specialis ts as Anew Climate and Aurora Sustainable Lands, who \ndevelop high-quality projects aimed at the sustainable preservation of natural carbon sinks which is essential to \nachieve carbon neutrality,” said Adrien Henry, Vice President Nature Based Solutions at TotalEnergies \nExploration & Production. “TotalEnergi es has very positively received the U. S. government’s recently published \nguiding principles on Voluntary Carbon Markets and is committed to follow them to contribute to strengthening integrity and transparency in these markets,  as demonstrated by this partnership.” \n \n134 “Anew Climate is honored to partner with TotalEnergies on their journey to reach carbon neutrality,” said Angela \nSchwarz, Anew Climate CEO. “As we worked closely with the TotalEnergies Nature Based Solutions team \nthroughout the stringent due diligence process, it was clear that their commitment to avoiding and reducing \nemissions as a first principle while recognizing the co-benefits of investing in meaningful carbon projects as part \nof a comprehensive climate action strategy aligned perfectly with Anew’s mission. We have a shared belief that \nan ‘all of the above’ strategy is required  to achieve meaningful climate impact.” \n“Aurora’s carbon stewardship enhances climate res ilience while safeguarding vital ecosystems across our \nforestlands,” said Jamie Houston, CEO of Aurora Sustai nable Lands. “Thanks to TotalEnergies’ steadfast trust \nand investment across our portfolio, we can maintain th e delicate balance between forest health, soil quality, \nwatersheds, and wildlife habitats. Together we are yieldi ng substantial and lasting climate impact at a massive \nscale.” \n \n \nUnited Kingdom: TotalEnergies la unches a floating offshore wind pilot project to supply renewable \nelectricity to an offshore oil & gas platform in the North Sea \nOn 29 August 2024, TotalEnergies announced the launch of a pilot project consisting in a floating wind turbine \nto supply renewable power to Culzean offshore platform in the UK North Sea, thus pioneering an innovative \ndecarbonization scheme. \nThe 3 MW floating wind turbine will be located 2 km west  of the Culzean platform, 220 km off the eastern coast \nof Scotland. This turbine, expected to be fully operational by end 2025, will supply around 20% of Culzean’s \npower requirement, thereby reducing its  GHG emissions. The turbine will be installed on a modular, light semi-\nsubmersible floater hull designed by Ocergy, allo wing for fast assembly  and optimized costs. \n“This innovative pilot project aims at proving the concep t of hybridization of power generation on an offshore \nfacility, by integrating the generation of renewable electric ity from a floating wind turbine with the existing power \ngeneration from gas turbines. It also aims at qualifying a promising floater design for the future of floating offshore \nwind”, said Marie-Noelle Semeria, Chie f Technology Officer at TotalEnergies. \n\n \n135 This pilot project was selected in Crown Estate Sco tland’s Innovation and Targeted Oil & Gas (INTOG) leasing \nround, designed to encourage and support the use of offshore wind energy to directly supply offshore oil & gas \nplatforms. \nAppointments to the Executive  Committee at TotalEnergies \nOn 26 August 2024 – Effective 1 September 2024: \n• Bernard PINATEL , currently President Refining & Chemical s, was appointed President Downstream \nand President Marketing & Services, member of the Executive Committee. \n• Vincent STOQUART , currently senior vice president Renewabl es was appointed Pr esident Refining & \nChemicals, member of the Executive Committee . \nEffective 1 September 2024, TotalEnergies’ Executive Committee will comprise: \n• Patrick Pouyanné , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer \n• Aurélien Hamelle , President for Strategy & Sustainability \n• Helle Kristoffersen , President Asia \n• Stéphane Michel , President of Gas, Renewables and Power \n• Bernard Pinatel , President Downstream and Pr esident Marketing & Services \n• Jean-Pierre Sbraire , Chief Financial Officer \n• Namita Shah , President, OneTech \n• Vincent Stoquart , President Refining & Chemicals \n• Nicolas Terraz , President, Exploration & Production \nUnited States: First Oil from the Anchor field in Gulf of Mexico \nOn 12 August 2024, TotalEnergies announced the start of  production from the Anchor field, located in the US \nGulf of Mexico, in which the Company has a 37.14% interest alongside operator Chevron (62.86%). \nLocated 225 kilometres off the Loui siana coast, Anchor, which developm ent was launched in December 2019, \nconsists of a system of subsea wells connected to a semi-submersible floating production unit (FPU) with a \nproduction capacity of 75,000 barrels of oil per day and 28 million cubic feet of gas per day. At plateau, Anchor \nwill represent close to 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) net for TotalEnergies. The Anchor FPU has \nbeen designed to minimize greenhouse gas emissions throug h an all-electric configura tion, with electric motors \nand electronic controls, and the utilization of waste heat and vapor recovery technologies. \n“The start-up of Anchor is a new milestone in the deploy ment of TotalEnergies’ inte grated energy model in the \nUS, combining the development of oil projects with a hi gh leverage to price and a low emissions intensity and \ngrowth in Integrated LNG and Integrat ed Power. Delivered safely, on time an d within budget, this project will \ncontribute to the Company’s free cash flow growth traj ectory” said Nicolas Terraz, President, Exploration & \nProduction at TotalEnergies. \nTotalEnergies sells its shares in Total Parco in Pakistan \nOn 6 August 2024, TotalEnergies has signed an agreement to sell its 50% stake in Total PARCO Pakistan Limited \n(TPPL) to Gunvor Group, a leading global commodities trading company.

On the occasion, Patrick Pouyanné said: \n“TotalEnergies generated robust financial results in the second quarter, with adjusted net income of $4.7 billion \nand cash flow of $7.8 billion resulting in first half adjusted net income and cash flow of close to $10 billion and \n$16 billion, respectively.  \nDuring the first half of 2024, TotalEnergies has completed important steps in advancing the balanced transition \nstrategy presented to shareholders at our Investor Day in September 2023:  \n- within the Oil & Gas pillar, TotalEnergies took fin al investment decision on several Upstream projects \nthat are the stepping stone s to achieve its objectives of growi ng upstream production by 2-3%/year and \ngrowing underlying cash flow: Kaminho in Angola, Sépia 2 and Atapu 2 in Brazil, Marsa LNG in Oman and the Ubeta gas project in Nigeria that supplies Nigeria LNG;  \n- within the Integrated Power pillar, TotalEnergies has fortified its Integrated Power portfolio with the \nacquisition of several flexible assets that allow the Company to extract ma ximum value out of its \nrenewable assets in three key markets: CCGTs in Texas and the UK, and a renewables aggregator and battery developer in Germany.  \nDuring the second quarter, upstream production was 2.44 Mboe/d, benefiting from high availability of production \nfacilities. Exploration & Production posted $2.7 billion of adjusted net operating income and $4.4 billion of cash \nflow, in line with the evolution of the oil and gas price environment. The Company further highgraded its portfolio, notably through acquisitions in Malaysia and deep offshore Congo, and divestments of mature assets in Nigeria, \nCongo, the UK and in Brunei.  \nIntegrated LNG posted adjusted net operating income and cash flow of $1.2 billion this quarter, reflecting the \naverage LNG price. TotalEnergies actively continues to  increase medium-term oil exposure within its LNG \nportfolio by signing two new mid- term Brent-indexed LNG sales contracts in Asia for 1.3 Mt/y.  \nIntegrated Power reported adjusted net operating income of $0.5 billion and cash flow of $0.6 billion with a \nreturn on capital employed above 10%. First half 2024 cash flow is $1.3 billion, in line with the annual guidance of more than $2.5 billion.  \nDownstream posted adjusted net operating income of $1.0 billion and cash flow of $1.8 billion, wherein the less \nfavorable refining margin environment was partially co mpensated by higher refinery utilization and sequential \nresults from marketing activities benefitting from cheaper supply.  \n \n(1) Refer to Glossary for the definitions and further inform ation on alternative performance measures (Non-GAAP measures) \nand infra and following for reconciliation tables \n\n \n137 During the quarter, TotalEnergies successf ully issued conventional senior bonds on the US  market totaling $4.25 \nbillion, with a 27-year average maturity. The Board of Directors decided to retain flexibility on the format of its \nsenior bonds issuances while also prioritizing long maturity.  \nComforted by robust results at mid-year, in line with 2024 objectives, the Board of Directors decided to maintain \nthe second interim dividend at 0.79 €/share for fiscal year 2024, an increase close to 7% compared to 2023, and authorized the Company to buy back shares for up to $2 billion in the third quarter of 2024.  \nThe Board also highlighted the recent success of the Capital increase reserved for employees, which brings \nTotalEnergies’ employee ownership to mo re than 8% of the Company’s share capital, and the strong shareholder \nsupport for all the resolutions submitted to vote at the Annual General Meeting.” \n 1.

Analysis of business segments9 \n4.1 Exploration & Production \n4.1.1 Production \n \n4.1.2 Results \n \nExploration & Production adjusted net operating income wa s $2,667 million in the second quarter 2024, up 5% \nquarter-to-quarter, driven by higher oil prices that we re partially compensated by lower gas realizations and \nproduction.  \nCash flow from operations excluding working capital (CFFO) was $4,353 million in the second quarter 2024, \ndown 3% quarter-to-quarter. The difference in quarterly variation between adjusted net operating income and CFFO is mainly linked to the tax impact of an ove rlift position at the end of the quarter in Norway. \n \n(15)  Effective tax rate = (tax on adjusted net operating income) / (adjusted net operating income – income from equity affiliates \n– dividends received from investments – impairment of  goodwill + tax on adjusted net operating income). \n\n \n142 4.2 Integrated LNG \n4.2.1 Production \n \nHydrocarbon production for LNG in the second quarter 2024 was up 1% quarter-to-quarter, notably linked to the \nentry into the Dorado gas field (Eagle Ford basin) in  the United States early in the second quarter 2024.  \nLNG sales decreased by 18% quarter-to-quarter, notably due to lower spot purchases, in a context of lower LNG \ndemand in Europe. \n4.2.2 Results \n \nIntegrated LNG adjusted net operating income was $1,152 million in the second quarter 2024, down 6% quarter-\nto-quarter, linked to lower LNG prices and sales. Moreover, gas trading did not fully benefit in markets characterized by lower volatility than during first half of 2023.  \nCash flow from operations excluding working capital (CFFO) was $1,220 million in the second quarter 2024, \ndown 9% quarter-to-quarter, for the same reasons. \n\n \n143 4.3 Integrated Power \n4.3.1 Productions, capacities, clients and sales \n \nNet power production was 9.1 TWh in the second quarter 2024, down 5% quarter-to-quarter and linked to lower \nproduction from flexible gas assets due to lower demand in Europe, partially compensated by production from renewable sources, which was up 13%.  \nGross installed renewable power generation capacity reached 24.0 GW at the end of the second quarter 2024, up \n0.5 GW quarter-to-quarter and including 0.2 GW installed in the United States and 0.2 GW in India. \n \n4.3.2 Results \n \nIntegrated Power adjusted net operating income was $5 02 million in the second quarter 2024, up 12% yearon-\nyear, reflecting activity growth. The decrease in adjusted net operating in come quarter-to-quarter reflects in \nparticular the seasonality of electricity demand in Europe.  \nCash flow from operations excluding working capital (CFFO) was $623 million, up  27% year-on-year and down \n10% quarter-to-quarter, for the same reasons.  \nIntegrated Power adjusted net operating income was $1,113 million in the first half 2024, up 36% year-on-year \nreflecting activity growth.  Cash flow from operations excluding working capital (C FFO) was $1,315 million, up  41% year-on-year, for the \nsame reason. \n\n \n144 4.4 Downstream (Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services) \n4.4.1 Results \n \n \n4.5 Refining & Chemicals \n4.5.1 Refinery and petrochemicals throughput and utilization rates \n \nRefining throughput was up 6% quarter-to-quarter in the second quarter, mainly due to lower planned \nmaintenance. Utilization rate was 84.5% in the second quarter 2024. \n\n \n145 4.5.2 Results \n \nRefining & Chemicals adjusted net operating income wa s $639 million in the second quarter 2024, down 34% \nquarter-to-quarter, due to lower refining margins mainly in Europe (ERM was down 37% quarter-to-quarter) and the Middle East that were partially compensated by  the increase in the refineries’ utilization rate.  \nCash flow from operations excluding working capital (CFFO) was $1,117 million, down 13% quarter-to-quarter, \nfor the same reasons. \n \n4.6 Marketing & Services \n4.6.1 Petroleum product sales \n \nSales of petroleum products in the second quarter 2024 were down year-on-year by 2%, mainly due to lower diesel \ndemand in Europe that was partially compensated by higher activity in the aviation business. \n4.6.2 Results \n \nMarketing & Services adjusted net operating income was $379 million for the second quarter 2024, up 49% \nquarter-to-quarter, benefiting from higher margins due to lower refining margins.  \nCash flow from operations excluding working capital (CFFO) was $659 million in the second quarter 2024, up \n38% quarter-to-quarter for the same reason. \n\n \n146 5.

TotalEnergies repurchased:  \n• 28.1 million shares in the second quarter 2024 for $2 billion,  \n• 58.7 million shares in the first half 2024 for $4 billion. \n 5.4 Acquisitions – asset sales \nAcquisitions were:  \n• $544 million in the second quarter 2024, primarily relate d to the acquisitions of a 20% interest in the Dorado \ngas field in the United States and of the German  renewable energy aggregator Quadra Energy,  \n• $1,618 million in the first half 2024, related to the ab ove elements as well as the acquisition of 1.5 GW of \nflexible gas capacity in Texas, battery storage developer Kyon in Germany, and Talos Low Carbon Solutions, \nin the carbon storage indust ry in the United States.  \n \nDivestments were  \n• $324 million in the second quarter 2024, primarily re lated to the farmdown of the Seagreen offshore wind \nfarm in the United Kingdom and the sale of  petrochemical assets in Lavera, France,  \n• $1,898 million in the first half 2024, related to the above  elements as well as the closing of the retail network \ntransaction with Alimentation Couche-T ard in Belgium, Luxemburg, and th e Netherlands, and the sale of a \n15% interest in Absheron, in Azerbaijan. \n \n147 5.5 Net cash flow (1) \nTotalEnergies’ net cash flow was:  \n• $3,147 million in the second quarter 2024 compared to $4,596 million in the first quarter 2024, reflecting the \n$391 million decrease in CFFO and the $1,058 million increase in net investments to $4,630 million in the \nsecond quarter 2024,  \n• $7,743 million in the first half 2024 compared to $7,095 million a year ago, reflecting the $2,161 million \ndecrease in CFFO and the $2,809 million decrease in net in vestments to $8,202 million in the first half 2024,  \n2024 second quarter cash flow from operating activities was $9,007 million versus CFFO of $7,777 million, and \nwas impacted by a decrease in working capital of $1.2 billion, mainly due to:  \n• $0.5 billion stock effect at the end of the quarter,  \n• ($1.7) billion decrease in working capital, of which ($0. 6) billion linked to the seasonality of the gas and power \nretail business. \n 5.6 Profitability \nReturn on equity was 18.7% for the twelve months ended 30 June 2024. \n \nReturn on average capital employed \n(1) was 16.6% for the twelve months ended 30 June 2024. \n \n6. TotalEnergies SE statutory accounts \nNet income for TotalEnergies SE, the parent company, amounted to:  \n• €4,555 million in the second quarte r 2024, compared to €4,851 million in the second quarter 2023,  \n• €7,965 million in the first half 2024, compared to €7,040 million in the first half 2023, \n \n7. Annual 2024 Sensitivities (16) 10 \n \n \n(16)  Sensitivities are revised once per year upon publication of th e previous year’s fourth quarter results. Sensitivities are \nestimates based on assumptions about TotalEnergies’ portfolio  in 2024. Actual results could vary significantly from \nestimates based on the application of these sensitivities. The imp act of the $-€ sensitivity on adjusted net operating income \nis essentially attributable to Refining & Chemicals.  \n(17)  In a 80 $/b Brent environment. \n\n \n148 8. Outlook \nBrent prices remain above $80 /b at the start of the third quarter, with  the OPEC+ countries having declared in \nearly June 2024 the intention to continue their policy to sustain a stable oil market.  \nGlobal refining margins, which have sharply decreased since the end of the first quarter 2024, remain impacted \nby low diesel demand in Europe, as well as by the ma rket normalization following the disruption in Russian \nsupply.  \nGiven the lower seasonal demand in Europe, European gas prices are expected to be between $8 and $10/Mbtu in \nthe third quarter 2024. However, in a context of supply tensions, Asian LNG prices are above $12/Mbtu, supported \nby higher demand, notably in China and India. Given the evolution of oil and gas prices in recent months and the lag effect on price formulas, TotalE nergies anticipates that its averag e LNG selling price should be around \n$10/Mbtu in the third quarter 2024.  \nThird quarter 2024 hydrocarbon production is expected to be between 2.4 and 2.45 Mboe/d. Start-up of Anchor, \nin the US Gulf of Mexico, is expected in the third quarter.  \nThe third quarter 2024 refining utilization rate is anticipat ed to be above 85%, benefiting from the restart of the \nDonges refinery in France.  \nThe Company confirms net investments guidance of $17-$18 billion in 2024, of which $5 billion are dedicated to \nIntegrated Power. \n \n149 9.

This indicator can be a valuable tool for decisi on makers, analysts and shareholders alike to measure and compar e the \nCompany’s profitability with utility  companies (energy sector).  \nAdjusted net income (TotalEnergies share)  is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most di rectly comparable IFRS measure is Net Income \n(TotalEnergies share). Adjusted Net Income (TotalEnergies share) refers to Net Income  (TotalEnergies share) less adjustment ite ms to Net \nIncome (TotalEnergies share). Adjustment items are inventory valu ation effect, effect of changes in fair value, and special ite ms. This indicator \ncan be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and share holders alike to evaluate the Company’s operating results and to understand its \noperating trends by removing the impact of non-operational results and special items.  \nAdjusted net operating income  is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly  comparable IFRS measure is Net Income. Adjusted \nNet Operating Income refers to Net Income before net cost of ne t debt, i.e., cost of net debt ne t of its tax effects, less adju stment items. \nAdjustment items are inventory valuation effe ct, effect of changes in fair value, a nd special items. Adjusted Net Operating Inc ome can be a \nvaluable tool for decision makers, analysts  and shareholders alike to evaluate th e Company’s operating results and understandin g its operating \ntrends, by removing the impact of non-operational results and special items and is used to evaluate the Return on Average Capit al Employed \n(ROACE) as explained below.  \nCapital Employed  is a non-GAAP financial measure. They are calculated at re placement cost and refer to capital employed (balance sheet) \nless inventory valuations effect. Capital employed (balance sheet ) refers to the sum of the fo llowing items: (i) Property, plan t and equipment, \nintangible assets, net, (ii) I nvestments & loans in equity a ffiliates, (iii) Other non-current assets, (iv) Working capital whi ch is the sum of: \nInventories, net, A ccounts receivable, net, other curr ent assets, Accounts payable, Othe r creditors and accrued liabilities(v) Provisions and \nother non-current liabilities and (vi) Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale . Capital Employed can be a valuable t ool for decision \nmakers, analysts and shareholders alike to  provide insight on the amount of capital i nvestment used by the Company or its busin ess segments \nto operate. Capital Employed is used to calculate  the Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE).  \nCash Flow From Operations excluding working capital (CFFO)  is a non-GAAP financial measure and its  most directly comparable IFRS \nmeasure is Cash flow from operating activities.  Cash Flow From Operati ons excluding working capital is defined as cash flow fro m operating \nactivities before changes in working capital at  replacement cost, excluding the mark-to-ma rket effect of Integrated LNG and Int egrated Power \ncontracts, including capital gain from renewa ble projects sales and including organic lo an repayments from equity affiliates.  \nThis indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analys ts and shareholders alike to he lp understand changes in cash f low from \noperating activities, excluding the impact of working capital changes across periods on a consistent basis and with the perform ance of peer \ncompanies in a manner that, when viewed in combination with the Company’s results prepared in  accordance with GAAP, provides a more \ncomplete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Co mpany’s business and performance. This performance indicator i s used by \nthe Company as a base for its cash flow a llocation and notably to guide on the share of  its cash flow to be allocated to the di stribution to \nshareholders.  \nDebt adjusted cash flow (DACF)  is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most direct ly comparable IFRS measure is Cash flow from \noperating activities. DACF is defined as Cash  Flow From Operations excluding working capital (CFFO) without financial charges. This \nindicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike because it corresponds to the funds theor etically available \nto the Company for investments, debt repa yment and distribution to shareholders, a nd therefore facilitates comparison of the Co mpany’s \nresults of operations with those of other registrants, independent of their capita l structure and working capital requirements.   \nFree cash flow after Organic Investments  is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most dir ectly comparable IFRS measure is Cash flow \nfrom operating activities. Free cash flow after Organic Investments, refers to Cash Fl ow From Operations excluding working capi tal minus \nOrganic Investments. Organic Investments refer to Net Investme nts excluding acquisitions, asset sa les and other transactions wi th non-\ncontrolling interests. This indicator can be a valuable tool fo r decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike because it il lustrates operating \ncash flow generated by the business post allo cation of cash for Organic Investments.  \nGearing  is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable  IFRS measure is the ratio of  total financial liabilities to t otal \nequity. Gearing is a Net-debt-to-capital ratio, which is calculat ed as the ratio of Net debt excluding leases to (Equity + Net debt excluding \nleases). This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision make rs, analysts and shareholders alike to assess the strength of t he Company’s \nbalance sheet.  \nNet cash flow  is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparab le IFRS measure is Cash flow from operating activities. Net \ncash flow refers to Cash Flow From Operations excluding worki ng capital minus Net Investments. Net cash flow can be a valuable tool for \ndecision makers, analysts and shareholders alike because it illu strates cash flow generated by the operations of the Company po st allocation \nof cash for Organic Investments and Acquisiti ons net of assets sales (acquisitions - assets sales - other operations with non-c ontrolling \ninterests). This performance indicator corresponds to the cash flow  available to repay debt and allocate cash to shareholder di stribution or \nshare buybacks.  \nNet investments  is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparab le IFRS measure is Cash flow used in investing activities. \nNet Investments refer to Cash flow used in investing activitie s including other transactions with non-controlling interests, in cluding change in \ndebt from renewable projects financing, including expenditures related to carbon cr edits, including capex linked to capitalized  leasing contracts \nand excluding organic loan repayment from e quity affiliates. This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analyst s and \nshareholders alike to illustrate the cash di rected to growth opportunities, both intern al and external, thereby showing, when c ombined with the \n \n158 Company’s cash flow statement prepared under IFRS, how cash is ge nerated and allocated for uses within the organization. Net In vestments \nare the sum of Organic Investments and Acquisitions net of a ssets sales each of which is described in the Glossary.  \nOrganic investments  is a non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comp arable IFRS measure is Cash  flow used in investing \nactivities. Organic investments refers to Net Investments, excluding acquisitions, a sset sales and other operations with non-co ntrolling \ninterests. Organic Investments can be a valuable tool for deci sion makers, analysts and shareholders alike because it illustrat es cash flow used \nby the Company to grow its asset base, excluding sources of external growth.  \nPayout  is a non-GAAP financial measure. Payout is defined as the ra tio of the dividends and share buybacks for cancellation to the Ca sh Flow \nFrom Operations excluding working capital. Th is indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders  as it provides \nthe portion of the Cash Flow From Operations excludi ng working capital distributed to the shareholder.  \nReturn on Average Capital Employed (ROACE)  is a non-GAAP financial measure. ROACE is th e ratio of Adjusted Net Operating Income \nto average Capital Employed at replacement cost between the beginning and the end of the period. This indicator can be a valuab le tool for \ndecision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to measure th e profitability of the Company’s average Capital Employed in its business \noperations and is used by the Company to benchmark its performance internally and ex ternally with its peers. \n \n159 Disclaimer: \nFinancial information by business segment is reported in accorda nce with the internal reporting system and shows internal segme nt information that is used to \nmanage and measure the performance of TotalEnergies. In addit ion to IFRS measures, certain al ternative performance indicators a re presented, such as \nperformance indicators excluding the adjus tment items described below (adjusted operating income, adjusted net operating income , adjusted net income), return \non equity (ROE), return on average capital employed (ROACE), g earing ratio, operating cash flow before working capital changes,  the shareholder rate of return. \nThese indicators are meant to facilitate the analysis of the financial perfor mance of TotalEnergies and the comparison of incom e between periods. They allow \ninvestors to track the measures used internally to manage and measure the performance of TotalEnergies. \nThese adjustment items include: \n(i) Special items  \nDue to their unusual nature or particular significance, certain transactions qualifying as \"special items\" are excluded from th e business segment figures. In general, \nspecial items relate to transactions that are significant, infr equent, or unusual. However, in certain instances, transactions such as restructuring costs or assets \ndisposals, which are not considered to be representative of th e normal course of business, may qualify as special items althoug h they may have occurred in prior \nyears or are likely to occur in following years. \n(ii) The inventory valuation effect \nIn accordance with IAS 2, TotalEnergies values inventories of petroleum products in its financial statements according to the F irst-In, First-Out (FIFO) method \nand other inventories using the weighted-average cost method. Under the FIFO method, the cost of inventory is based on the hist oric cost of acquisition or \nmanufacture rather than the current replacement cost. In volatile  energy markets, this can have  a significant distorting effect  on the reported income. Accordingly, \nthe adjusted results of the Refining & Chem icals and Marketing & Services segments ar e presented according to the replacement c ost method. This method is \nused to assess the segments’ performance a nd facilitate the comparability of the segmen ts’ performance with those of its main c ompetitors. \nIn the replacement cost method, which approx imates the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method, the variation of inventory values in t he statement of income is, \ndepending on the nature of the inventory, determined using eithe r the month-end prices differential between one period and anot her or the average prices of the \nperiod rather than the historical value. The inventory valuation  effect is the difference betwee n the results under the FIFO an d the replacement cost methods. \n(iii) Effect of changes in fair value The effect of changes in fair value presented as an adjustment item reflects, for trading inventories and storage contracts, di fferences between internal measures \nof performance used by TotalEnergies’ Executive Committe e and the accounting for thes e transactions under IFRS. \nIFRS requires that trading inventories be recorded at their fair  value using period-end spot prices. In order to best reflect t he management of economic exposure \nthrough derivative transactions, internal indicators used to me asure performance include valuations of trading inventories base d on forward prices. \nTotalEnergies, in its trading activities, enters into storage cont racts, whose future ef fects are recorded at  fair value in Tot alEnergies’ internal economic performance. \nIFRS precludes recognition of  this fair value effect. \nFurthermore, TotalEnergies enters into derivative instruments to risk manage certain operational contracts or assets. Under IFR S, these derivatives are recorded \nat fair value while the underlying operationa l transactions are recorded as they occur.  Internal indicators defer the fair valu e on derivatives to match with the \ntransaction occurrence. \nThe adjusted results (adjusted operating income, adjusted net ope rating income, adjusted net inco me) are defined as replacement  cost results, adjusted for special \nitems, excluding the effect of changes in fair value. \nEuro amounts presented for the fully adjusted-diluted earnings pe r share represent dollar amounts converted at the average euro -dollar (€-$) exchange rate for the \napplicable period and are not the result of financial statements prepared in euros. \n \n160 Renewables: TotalEnergies Acquires a Portfolio of Hydropower Projects in Africa to Deploy its Multi-\nEnergy Strategy \nOn 30 July 2024, TotalEnergies has signed an agreement with Scatec, a Norwegian renewable energy company, \nto acquire 100% of its subsidiary SN Power, which holds interests in renewable hydropower projects in Africa, \nthrough a joint venture (51% SN Power) with No rfund and British International Investment (BII). \nAs a result of this transaction, whic h is subject to certain previous conditions, TotalEnergies will acquire a 28.3% \nstake in the Bujagali hydropower plant currently in opera tion in Uganda. With a capacity of 250 MW, it covers \nmore than 25% of the country's peak electricity demand. \nTotalEnergies will also acquire minority stakes in two projects under development in Rwanda (206 MW) and \nMalawi (360 MW). \n“This acquisition of renewable hydroelectric assets and proj ects in Africa reflects our desire to contribute to the \ncontinent's energy transition by bringing electricity to the people of Af rican countries. In particular, we are \ndelighted to be able to become a player in hydro power in Uganda, a country where we are also developing a major oil project. This is another example of TotalEnergie s’ ability to implement its multi-energy strategy in oil-\nproducing countries to support them in their energy tr ansition,” said Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of \nTotalEnergies. \n“We are pleased to announce t oday’s transaction, as we believe TotalEnergies will be a strong asset owner going \nforward, with the ability to further develop the projects and contribute to the energy transition in Africa.

This decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024, for a production start-up in 2028. \nTotalEnergies is the operator of Block 58 with a 50% interest, alongside APA Corporation (50%). Staatsolie has \nthe option to enter the development project with up to 20% interest upon FID. \nEngineering studies (FEED) are progressing for the development of the Sapakara and Krabdagu fields, with \ncombined recoverable resources estimated above 700 million barrels thanks to the integration of Water Alternating \nGas (WAG) injection technology to maximize recovery. Ocean Bottom Node (OBN) seismic technology will also \nplay a key role in maximizing resources and the placem ent of the development wells, as well as identifying \nresource upsides. A first OBN campaign covering 900 km2will be carried out in second half of 2024. \nSome key milestones have been recently reached in the path towards FID. An agreement was concluded between \nStaatsolie and TotalEnergies on the field development area, maximizing the value for Suriname and the Block 58 co-venturers over the 25 years Production Period. In additio n, the hull for the 200,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) \nFloating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit has been secured. \nTotalEnergies is committed to developing this project responsibly using the best technologies to minimize \ngreenhouse gas emissions. In particular, the facilities will be  designed for zero routine flaring, with all associated \ngas reinjected into the reservoirs. During the developm ent and production phases, TotalEnergies will work closely \nwith Staatsolie to enhance local content, as already de monstrated during the exploration and appraisal phases, \nwith over 80 people trained for logistics operations in Paramaribo. \n“We are glad to progress together w ith Staatsolie and APA towards the FID of Block 58, which will be the next \nmilestone in the partnership between Suriname and TotalEnergies. Our Company is deploying advanced \ntechnologies to minimize the environm ental impact and maximize resource r ecovery, while focusing on ensuring \neconomic benefits for the country,” said Javier Rielo, Senior Vice President Ameri cas, Exploration & Production \nat TotalEnergies. \n“Staatsolie is happy to progress towards the development of this project with a world-renowned partner in such a \nway that Suriname optimally benefits not only from large financial streams but as well from a design and execution \nthat will safeguard safe and clean operations ,” said Annand Jagesar, CEO of Staatsolie. \nTotalEnergies Increases LNG Deliveries to Asia  with Two New Medium and Long-Term Contracts \nOn 4 June 2024, in line with its strategy to grow its li quefied natural gas (LNG) business, TotalEnergies announces \nthe signing of two new LNG medium- and long-term contracts in Asia: \n- a sales and purchase agreement (SPA) with Indian O il Corporation (IOCL) for the delivery to India of \nup to 800,000 tons per year of LNG for ten years from 2026; and \n- an agreement (HoA) with Korea So uth-East Power for the delivery to South Korea of up to around \n500,000 tons per year of LNG for five years from 2027. \nThese agreements allow TotalEnergies to secure medium -term outlets for its global LNG supply portfolio.

By combining competitive hydrogen production in \nTunisia and pipeline-based transportation, we can ensure a long-term supply at scal e to support a sustainable \ntransition of our customers to green hydrogen as well as  support a sustainable economic development in Tunisia. \nWe are delighted to be working with a strong consortium capable of realizing GW-scale projects and look forward to developing them in partnership and close collaboration with the Tunisian authorities and population.” \nBrazil: Final Investment Decision for Atapu-2 and Sépia-2 Oil Developments On 27 May 2024, TotalEnergies, together with the operat or Petrobras and their partners in the Atapu and Sépia \nconsortiums, have taken the Final Investment Decision (FID) for the second development phase of Atapu and Sépia fields, located in the prolific pre-salt Santos Basin, offshore Brazil. \nThe Atapu field has been producing since 2020 through the P-70 Floating Production Storage and Offloading \n(FPSO) unit, with a production capacity of 150,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd). The second development phase, \nAtapu-2, will comprise a new-built FPSO of 225,000 bopd capacity. TotalEnergies owns an interest of 15% in the \nAtapu field, in partnership with Petrobras (65.7%, operator), Shell (16.7%), Petrogal (1.7%) and PPSA (0.9%). \nThe Sépia field has been producing since 2021 through the Carioca FPSO unit, with a production capacity of \n180,000 bopd. The second development phase, Sépia-2, will also comprise a new-built FPSO of 225,000 bopd capacity. TotalEnergies owns an interest of 16.9% in the Sépia field, in partnership with Petrobras (55.3%, operator), Petronas (12.7%), QatarEnergy (12.7%) and Petrogal (2.4%). \nThe two FPSOs are expected to start pr oducing as from 2029. They have been designed to minimize greenhouse \ngas emissions through an all-electric co nfiguration and technologies such as waste heat recovery, closed flare, \ncargo oil tank gas recovery and variable speed drive for compressors and pumps. \n“The decision to launch Sépia-2 and Atapu-2 is a new milestone in our strong growth story in Brazil, a core area \nfor the Company thanks to its world-class low-emission  and low-cost oil resources” declared Nicolas Terraz, \nPresident Exploration & Production of TotalEnergies. “Following the startup of Mero-2 in late 2023 and the \nupcoming startups of Mero-3 in 2024 and Mero-4 in 2025, Brazil will soon account for more than 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in equity production for the Company. At their plateau Sépia-2 and Atapu-2, the \ntenth and eleventh FPSO for TotalEnergies in Brazil, will contribute to maintain TotalEnergies production in this \nkey country above 200,000 boepd.” \nAngola: TotalEnergies launches the Kaminho deepwater project \nOn 20 May 2024, Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies, met in Luanda with João Lourenço, \nPresident of Angola, Diamantino Azev edo, Minister of Mineral Resources, Oil & Gas (MIREMPET), Paulino \nJerónimo, Chairman and CEO of ANPG and Gaspar Martins, Chairman and CEO of Sonangol, to announce the Final Investment Decision of the Kaminho deepwater project. \nTotalEnergies (40%), along with its Block 20/11 partners, Petronas (40%) and Sonangol (20%), announced the \nFinal Investment Decision (FID) of the Kaminho project to develop the Cameia and Golfinho fields, located 100 \nkm off the coast of Angola, by 1,700 m water-depth. This FID has been made possible thanks to a close \ncollaboration with the concessionaire Agenci a Nacional de Petroleo e Gas (ANPG). \nThe Kaminho project which is the first large deepwater development in the Kwanza basin comprises the \nconversion of a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) to a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit, which will be connected to a subsea production network. Designed to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and \n \n172 eliminate routine flaring, this FPSO is all-electric and associated gas will be fully reinjected into the reservoirs. \nProduction start-up is expected in 2028, with a plateau of 70,000 barrels of oil per day. \nThe Kaminho project will involve over 10 million man-hour s in Angola, mainly with  offshore operations and \nconstruction at local yards. \nOn this occasion, TotalEnergies and Sonangol EP also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to share expertise \non Research & Technology, notably in  decarbonization of the Oil & Gas indu stry, with a strong focus on methane \nemissions reduction and renewable energies. TotalEnergie s’ teams will provide support to Sonangol EP for the \nstart-up and operation of its new Sumbe R&D center and for the development of the skills of the Sonangol research \nand technology teams, with a focus on reservoir geology, process electrification and photovoltaics. \nTotalEnergies takes action to give  access to clean cooking to 100 m illion people in Africa and India \nOn 14 May 2024, at the Clean Cooking Summit organi zed by the International Energy Agency (IEA), \nTotalEnergies announced its ambition of giving 100 million people in A frica and India access to clean cooking \nby 2030. TotalEnergies will therefore invest more than $400 million in the development of liquefied petroleum \ngas (LPG) for cooking. \nIn addition, to make clean cooking affordable for as many people as possible, the Company will develop the use \nof digital pay-as-you-cook technologies that allow customer s to pay only as they use the LPG cylinder, rather than \nhaving to pay the full value of the cylinder volume up front. \nThe company is already a major player in the distributio n of LPG in cylinders, with more than 50 million people \nin Africa and Asia benefiting already from a reliable and cleaner energy. \nNorway: First oil production on Eldfisk North On 8 May 2024, TotalEnergies announced the successful first oil production on the Eldfisk North Project, located \nin the Greater Ekofisk Area in the North Sea.  \nThe Eldfisk North Project is located in PL018, and th e licensees are TotalEnergie s EP Norge AS (39.896%), \nConocoPhillips Skandinavia AS (35.112% - Operator), Vå r Energi ASA (12.388%), Sval Energi AS (7.604%) \nand Petoro AS (5.000%).  \nIn December 2022, the Norwegian auth orities approved the Eldfisk North Pl an for Development and Operation \nwith original production start scheduled in the second quarter of 2024. Cooperation and efficiency across \ncompanies have unlocked earlier first oil production.  \nThe Eldfisk North Project comprises three 6-well subsea te mplates located approximately seven kilometers from \nthe Eldfisk Complex. The development includes up to 14 wells, whereof nine are producers and five will inject \nwater into the reservoir. The Eldfisk North Project will pr oduce 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at peak \nand use the available capacity of Eldfisk f acilities for processing and transportation.  \nThe project has created approximately 4,000 to 4,500 jobs, and more than 80% of the total contract value has been \nawarded to Norwegian businesses. \nTotalEnergies and Sinopec strengthen cooperation \nOn 7 May 2024, TotalEnergies, and China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (“SINOPEC”) signed a strategic \ncooperation agreement to deep en their collaboration, notabl y in low-carbon energies.  \nTotalEnergies and SINOPEC have been working together  for many years, notably in Angola and Brazil in \nupstream operations, and more generally in various domains such as oil, LNG, oil product trading, and \nengineering. More recently, the compan ies joined forces to develop a 230,000 tons per year sustainable aviation \nfuel (SAF) production unit at a SINOPEC refinery in China.  \nThis strategic cooperation agreement aims to further develop the partnership between TotalEnergies and \nSINOPEC and seize new opportunities by leveraging their respective expertise. In pa rticular, the two companies \nplan to combine their R&D expertise in biofuels, green hydrogen, CCUS and decarbonization.  \n \n173 TotalEnergies reaffirms the relevance of unified governance in order to pursue its transition strategy  \nOn 25 April 2024, the Board of Directors of TotalEnerg ies examined the draft resolution submitted by a group of \nshareholders representing less than 0.9% of the share cap ital and aiming to submit to the Annual General Meeting \nan advisory vote asking the Board of Directors to adopt a separation of the Ch airmanship of the Board of Directors \nand the General Management of the Company.  \nTotalEnergies Board of Directors reaffirms its strong commitment to shareholder dialogue and recalls that in 2023 \nit had invited shareholders who wished to open a debate with the Board of Directors to submit an item on the \nagenda of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders , as provided for in the French Commercial Code. The \nBoard of Directors therefore invited shareholders to consider this route for future Annual General Meetings, as it \nwill not support the advisory resolutions route in any matter.  \nTotalEnergies’ Board of Directors recalls that with a view  to renewing the mandate of  director of the Chairman \nand Chief Executive Officer, it carried out a review of th e choice of the most suitable mode of governance for the \nTotalEnergies and reported to its shareholders in a very detailed manner. The Governance and Ethics Committee’s \nconsidered the best interests of TotalEnergies, and afte r individual consultation of each Director by the Lead \nIndependent Director, led the Board of Directors to decide unanimously and with conviction at its meeting on 21 September 2023, to continue to combine positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  \nThe unity of TotalEnergies’ management and representation power is part of its particularly well-balanced \ncorporate governance framework, with a Lead Independent Director who is a preferred contact for shareholders \nand who has extensive powers, whom the Board of Directors has found to be fully fulfilling his role.  \nTotalEnergies’ Board of Directors has thus fully executed the mission for which the French law attributes to it the \nresponsibility: the French Commercial Code provides that it is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to \nchoose between the unified or separate mode of the fu nctions of Chairman and Chie f Executive Officer and that \nthe shareholders are informed of this choice. Shareholders’ right to information is supplemented by a requirement \nprovided for by the Afep-Medef Code of motivation for the Board’s decision. \nThe Board of Directors, chaired by the Lead Independen t Director and on the proposal of the Governance and \nEthics Committee, therefore unanimousl y decided not to include the aforementioned draft resolution on the agenda \nof the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.  \nWith regard to the debate on corporate governance initia ted by the above-mentioned group of shareholders, the \nLead Independent Director will, at the request of the Board of Directors, report on the performance of his mission, \nin particular on the Board’s motivatio n in respect of the governance structure of the Company, during the Annual \nGeneral Meeting of 24 May 2024.  \nFurthermore, the Board of Directors examined the proposed resolution aiming to reduce the authorization \nrequested by the Board of Directors at  the Shareholders’ Meeting for the pur pose of carrying out share buybacks \nand noted that it was carried by certain shareholders repr esenting only 0.11 % of the share capital. The Board of \nDirectors noted that this proposed resolution is not admi ssible as it fails to meet the minimum holding threshold \nrequired by the French Commercial Code.  \nTotalEnergies ranks #1 in employee shareholder owners hip in Europe at over €11 billion of its capital  \nOn 25 April 2024, TotalEnergies’ Board of  Directors validated the following initiatives:  \n• The allocation of 100 TotalEnergies shares to each of its 100,000 employ ees worldwide. Th is is the most \nimportant universal grant in TotalEnergies’ history an d is in honor of its 100-year anniversary. This \nexceptional grant will be made to the Company’s employees on the date of the definitive grant by the Board, for those employed as of 28 March 2024. These shares will be definitively acquired by the employees present five year s after the grant date.  \n• A capital increase reserved for empl oyees and former employees for a €46.90 subscription price equal to \nthe average of the closing price of TotalEnergies sh ares on the Euronext over twenty consecutive trading \nsessions, with an exceptional 30% discount (compared to 20% in 2023).  \n• The performance share allocation plan, which is carried out annually.  \nTotalEnergies ranks #1 in employee shareholder ownership in Europe  \n \n174 TotalEnergies’ proactive policy puts the Company at the top of the ranking of European firms for employee \nshareholding, based on the amount of the share capital held by its employees (source: European Federation of \nEmployee Share ownership).  \nBy year-end 2023, over 65% of TotalE nergies’ employees were shareholders, holding about €11 billion out of the \nCompany’s €149 billion share capital. Consequently, wi th 7.4% of the capital, TotalEnergies’ employees \nrepresent the Company’s largest group of shareholders, receiving €525 million in dividends in 2023.  \nTotalEnergies announces the first int erim dividend of €0.79/share for fiscal  year 2024, an increase close to \n7% compared to 2023 \nOn 25 April 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”) met, under the \nchairmanship of Mr. Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and decided the distribution of a \nfirst interim dividend of 0.79 €/share for fiscal year 2024, an increase of 6.8% compared to the three interim \ndividends paid for fiscal year 2023 and identical to the final ordinary dividend for fiscal year 2023. This increase \nis in line with the shareholder return policy confir med by the Board of Directors in February 2024. \n This interim dividend will be paid in cash excl usively, according to the following timetable: \n \n Shareholders American Depositary Shares \nholders \nEx-dividend date 25 September 2024 24 September 2024 \nPayment date 1 October 2024 11 October 2024 \n \n \n175 TAXATION \nGeneral  Statement  \nThe tax legislation of investors’ home jurisdictions an d of the relevant Issuer’s jurisdiction of incorporation \nmay have an impact on the income received from the Notes. \n \n176 SUBSCRIPTION AND SALE \nSummary of Dealership Agreement Subject to the terms and on the cond itions contained in an Amended and Re stated Dealership Agreement dated on \nor about 10 September 2024 (the “ Dealership Agreement ”) between the Issuers, the Guarantor (in respect of \nNotes issued by TotalEnergies Capital or TotalEnergies Capital International), the dealers (the “ Permanent \nDealers ”) and the arranger (the “ Arranger ”) named on the back cover of this Debt Issuance Programme \nProspectus, the Notes will be offered on a continuous basi s by the relevant Issuer to the Permanent Dealers. \nHowever, each of the Issuers has reserved the right to sell Notes directly on its own beha lf to dealers that are not \nPermanent Dealers (any such institution, if appoin ted, in addition to the Permanent Dealers, a “ Dealer ”).

In such a case the Calculation Agent is likely to be a member of an international financial \ngroup that is involved, in the ordinary course of its business, in a wide range of banking activities out of which conflicting interests may arise. While such a Calculation Agent will, where relevant, have \ninformation barriers and procedures in place to manage  conflicts of interest, it may in its other banking \nactivities from time to time be engaged in transactions involving an index or related derivatives. \nFinally, in certain other instances, the relevant Issuer  itself may make determinations, including exercises \nof discretion, related to the Rate of Interest on a Tranche of Notes, including (as applicable): (i) requesting \nquotations from Reference Banks in respect of the Re ference Rate in the event that the Relevant Screen \nPage or Fallback Screen Page is not available, ( ii) determining the Reference Rate if EUR CMS is no \nlonger published or fewer than five quotations are prov ided and/or (iii) if no Ra te of Interest can be \ndetermined in accordance with the “2021 ISDA Defin itions” or “2006 ISDA Definitions”, decide how to \ndetermine the Rate of Interest.  \n(25) Issuers’ website \nThe website of TotalEnergies is www.totalenergies.com  and TotalEnergies Capital and TotalEnergies \nCapital International do not maintain their own sepa rate websites; however, information regarding each \ncan be found on the page www.totalenergies.com/investors/publications-and-regulated-\ninformation/other-information/bondholders-information .
