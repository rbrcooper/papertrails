This increase is comparable to the 7.1% \nincrease for fiscal year 2023 versus 2022.  \nConsequently, taking into account the three interim dividends of 0.79 €/share previously decided by the Board of \nDirectors, the final dividend for fiscal year 2024 w ill be 0.85 €/share, an increase of 7.6% compared to the final \ndividend of 2023 and the 3 interim dividends of 2024.  \nThe Board of Directors highlights the growth of the dividend paid during years 2023, 2024 and 2025, which have \nincreased or will increase b y 7.1%, 7.0% and 7.2% respectively, the Board is considering a first interim dividend for \n2025 (paid in the 4th quarter of 2025) at the level of the final dividend for fiscal year 2024.  \nSubject to approval at the Shareholders’ Meeting, the final dividend w ill be detached and paid in cash, according to \nthe following timetable:  \n   Shareholders  ADS holders  \nEx-dividend date  June 19, 2025  June 18, 2025  \nPayment date  July 1, 2025  July 11, 2025  \n \n16  \nFourth quarter and full -year 2024 results  \nTotalEnergies confirms that the unaudited results and other figures contained in the press release dated 5 February \n2025 and headed “ Fourth quarter and full -year 2024 results ” as reproduced below have been compiled and prepared \non a basis which is (i) comparable with th e consolidated financial statements of TotalEnergies as of and for the year \nended 31 December 2023 and (ii) consistent with TotalEnergies’ accounting principles and standards utilised for the \npreparation of the same consolidated financial statements.

On the occasion, Patrick \nPouyanné said:  \n“During the fourth quarter, TotalEnergi es leveraged its multi -energy integrated model, benefiting notably from \nstrong performance in Integrated LNG and Integrated Power, with $4.4 billion of adjusted net income, up 8% \ncompared to the third quarter, and $7.2 billion of CFFO, up 5%.  \nIn 2024, Tota lEnergies reported adjusted net income of $18.3 billion and cash flow of $29.9 billion in a softer \nenvironment mainly affected by a sharp decline in refining margins , after two exceptional years. 2024 IFRS net \nincome was $15.8 billion (€14.6 billion). The Company achieved nearly a 15% return on average capital employed \nin 2024, the best among the majors for the third consecutive year. TotalEnergies continued to implement its balanced \ngrowth strategy in a disciplined manner by investing $17.8 billion in 2024 , of which one third was in new Oil & Gas \nprojects and $4.8 billion in low -carbon energies, including $3.9 billion in Integrated Power. With $8 billion in share \nbuybacks*, payout reached 50% of cash flow. TotalEnergies ended the year with gearing below 10% , highlighting \nthe Company’s strong financial health.  \nIn the Oil & Gas business, fourth quarter production was 2.43 Mboe/d, benefiting from the ramp up of projects \ncommencing in 2024. With oil prices down $5/b compared to previous quarter, partially offset  by higher gas prices, \nExploration & Production delivered a strong quarter, with adjusted net operating income of $2.3 billion and cash \nflow of $3.9 billion. In 2024, TotalEnergies achieved five major projects start -ups (Mero -2 and Mero -3 in Brazil, \nAnchor  in the United States, Fenix in Argentina and Tyra in Denmark) that support 2025 production growth of more \n4Q24Change\nvs 3Q242024Change\nvs 2023\n Adjusted net income (TotalEnergies share)(1) \n- in billions of dollars (B$) 4.4 +8% 18.3 -21%\n- in dollars per share 1.90 +9% 7.77 -17%\n Net income (TotalEnergies share) (B$) 4.0 +72% 15.8 -26%\n Adjusted EBITDA(1) (B$) 10.5 +5% 43.1 -14%\n Cash flow from operations\n  excluding working capital (CFFO)(1) (B$)7.2 +5% 29.9 -17%\n Cash flow from operating activities (B$) 12.5 +74% 30.9 -24%\n \n17 than 3%. Exploration & Production generated adjusted net operating income of $10 billion and cash flow of $17 \nbillion. During the year, the Company s anctioned major oil projects in Suriname, Brazil and Angola, driving an \noutstanding reserves replacement ratio (157%) and a proved reserves life index greater than 12 years, reflecting the \ndepth of TotalEnergies’ Upstream portfolio. In 2024, TotalEnergies confirmed its low cost and low emission O&G \nmodel, with operating costs below $5/boe and GHG emissions2 and notably methane emissions down 3% and 15%, \nrespectively, over the year.  \nIntegrated LNG results meaningfully increased sequentially with adjusted net operating income and cash flow of \n$1.4 billion, up 35% and 63%, respectively, compared to the third q uarter, driven by 6% production growth, average \nLNG prices above $10/Mbtu and LNG trading performance back to the level of the fourth quarter 2023, taking \nadvantage of higher market volatility. For full -year 2024, Integrated LNG generated adjusted net oper ating income \nand cash flow of $4.9 billion. The Company enriched its portfolio in 2024 with the launch of Marsa LNG in Oman, \nUbeta in Nigeria, the Sapura OMV acquisition in Malaysia and the acquisition of dry gas assets in the Eagle Ford \nbasin in Texas. Mo reover, TotalEnergies continued to successfully market its LNG volumes by signing several new \nmedium -term sales contracts (6 Mt/ year) in Asia, mostly Brent -indexed.  \nDuring the fourth quarter, Integrated Power continued its track record of strong performa nce throughout the year \nwith a higher adjusted net operating income of $575 million and cash flow of $604 million. Full -year 2024 cash flow \ntotaled $2.6 billion, up 19% year -on-year and in line with annual Company guidance, and with a ROACE of 10%. \nNet ele ctricity production increased 23% year -on-year to 41 TWh and contributed to reducing the average lifecycle \ncarbon intensity of all energy products sold by the Company to its clients ( -17% vs. 2015). During 2024, \nTotalEnergies continued to deploy its differ entiated Integrated Power model in key targeted markets through strategic \nacquisitions: Quadra Energy and VSB that strengthen the Company’s position in Germany, and gas -fired power \nplants in the United States and the United Kingdom that further enhance the  Company’s flexible generation capacity. \nThanks to its portfolio, TotalEnergies anticipates growing power production to more than 50 TWh in 2025, equivalent \nto 10% of its hydrocarbon production.  \nDuring the fourth quarter, in a globally weak margin environm ent, Downstream adjusted net operating income was \n$680 million, up 12%, and cash flow was $1.4 billion, up 15%, following a $10/t increase in European refining \nmargins. Full -year 2024 adjusted net operating income was $3.5 billion, down from 2023 levels du e to a sharp \ndecline ( -44%) in European refining margins and downgraded operations in some units. Importantly, cash flow \nremained above $6  billion, demonstrating the resilience of the Company’s integrated Downstream model.  \nIn view of the free cash flow gr owth outlook and share buybacks executed in 2024 (5% of the share capital), the \nBoard of Directors will propose at the Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on May 23, 2025, the distribution of a final \n2024 dividend of €0.85/share, resulting in an increase of 7 % for the 2024 dividend to €3.22/share, compared to the \n2023 dividend . Furthermore, the Board of Directors confirmed a shareholder return policy for 2025 targeting >40% \nCFFO payout, which will combine interim dividends increasing by 7.6% to €0.85/share  and $2 billion of share \nbuybacks per quarter, a level which will be pursued under reasonable market conditions. ”\n \n*      Including coverage of employees share grant plans \n(2)  Scope 1+2 of Oil & Gas operated activities  \n \n18  \n1.

In 2025, TotalEnergies therefore reinforces its ambition \nthrough a new methane emissions reduction objective of -60% vs. 2020.  \n2024 Scope 3 (13) Category 11 emissions are estimated to be 347 Mt CO 2e vs. 355 Mt CO 2e in 2023.  \n \n     \n \n(11) The six greenhouse gases in the Kyoto protocol, namely CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6, with their respective GWP (Global W arming Potential) as \ndescribed in the 2021 IPCC report. HFCs, PFCs and SF6 are virtually absent from the Company’s emissions or are  considered as non -material and are therefore \nnot counted.  \n(12) Scope 1+2 GHG emissions of operated facilities are defined as the sum of direct emissions of greenhouse gases from sites or a ctivities that are included in the \nscope of reporting (as defined i n the Company’s 2023 Universal Registration Document) and indirect emissions attributable to brought -in energy (electricity, \nheat, steam), excluding purchased industrial gases (H2).  \n(13) TotalEnergies reports Scope 3 GHG emissions, category 11, which corre spond to indirect GHG emissions related to the end use of energy products sold to the \nCompany’s customers, i.e., from their combustion, i.e., combustion of the products to obtain energy. The Company follows the oil & gas industry reporting \nguidelines publi shed by IPIECA, which comply with the GHG Protocol methodologies. In order to avoid double counting, this methodology account s for the \nlargest volume in the oil, biofuels and gas value chains, i.e., the higher of the two production volumes or sales. For To talEnergies in 2024, the calculation of \nscope 3 GHG emissions for the oil and biofuels value chains considers product sales (higher than production) and for the gas value chain, marketable gas \nproduction (higher than gas sales either as LNG or as part of d irect sales to B2B/B2C).  \n4Q24 3Q244Q24\n vs \n3Q244Q23 Scope 1+2 emissions (MtCO 2e) 2024 20232024\n vs \n2023\n9.6 8.8 +9% 7.9 Scope 1+2 from operated facilities (12)34.3 34.6 -1%\n7.9 7.4 +7% 7.2 of which Oil & Gas 29.4 30.3 -3%\n1.7 1.4 +21% 0.7 of which CCGT 4.9 4.3 +14%\n12.2 11.7 +4% 11.5 Scope 1+2 - equity share 46.4 48.9 -5%\n4Q24 3Q244Q24\n vs \n3Q244Q23 Methane emissions (ktCH4) 2024 20232024\n vs \n2023\n7 7 - 9 Methane emissions from operated facilities 29 34 -15%\n9 8 +13% 11 Methane emissions - equity share 33 40 -18%\n \n21  \n3.3 Production(14)6 \n    \n     \nHydrocarbon production was 2,434 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2024, up 2% year -on-year (excluding \nthe Canada disposal representing 3.5%) and was comprised of:  \n• +3% due to start -ups and ramp -ups, including Mero -2 and Mero -3 in Brazil, Absheron in Azerbaijan, Bloc \n10 in Oman, Tommeliten Alpha in Norway, Akpo West in Nigeria, Fenix in Argentina and Anchor in the \nUnited States,  \n• +1% due to higher availability of production facilities,  \n• +1% portfolio ef fect related to entry into the producing fields of SARB Umm Lulu in the United Arab \nEmirates and Ratawi in Iraq and to the acquisition of interests in the Eagle Ford shale gas plays in Texas,  \n• -3% due to the natural field declines.  \n \n \n(14) Company production = E&P production + Integrated LNG production.  \n4Q24 3Q244Q24\n vs \n3Q244Q23 Hydrocarbon production 2024 20232024\n vs \n2023\n2,427 2,409 +1% 2,462 Hydrocarbon production (kboe/d) 2,434 2,483 -2%\n1,292 1,324 -2% 1,341 Oil (including bitumen) (kb/d) 1,314 1,388 -5%\n1,135 1,086 +5% 1,121 Gas (including condensates and associated NGL) (kboe/d) 1,120 1,095 +2%\n2,427 2,409 +1% 2,462 Hydrocarbon production (kboe/d) 2,434 2,483 -2%\n1,445 1,466 -1% 1,506 Liquids (kb/d) 1,468 1,550 -5%\n5,323 5,093 +5% 5,158 Gas (Mcf/d) 5,211 5,028 +4%\n \n22  \n4.

Outlook  \nAt the beginning of 2025, Brent prices remain volatile between $70 and $80/b, supported by the willingness of \nOPEC+ countries to balance oil markets that are facing strong supply growth from non -OPEC countries (US, Guyana, \nBrazil). According to the IEA, global oil demand is anticipated to grow by 1.1 Mb/d in 2025, up from a 0.8 Mb/d \nincrease in 2024.  \n \nEuropean gas prices increased at the end of 2024 and forward markets currently expect prices to be abo ve $13/Mbtu \nin the first quarter of 2025, supported by high winter consumption and rapid inventory declines in Europe in the \ncontext of the interruption of Russian imports via Ukraine. Gas markets should remain in tension in 2025 due to very \nlimited expect ed capacity additions related to delays of some projects. TotalEnergies expects more than 40 Mt of \nLNG sales in 2025. Given the evolution of oil and gas prices in the recent months and the lag effect on price formulas, \nTotalEnergies anticipates its average  LNG selling price will be above $10/Mbtu in the first quarter 2025.  \n \nIn 2025, TotalEnergies anticipates its hydrocarbon production will grow more than 3%, benefiting from the ramp -up \nof 2024 start -ups and production start -ups, notably Ballymore in the Gul f of Mexico and Mero -4 in Brazil.  \n \nFirst quarter 2025 hydrocarbon production is expected to be between 2.5 and 2.55 Mboe/d thanks to the ramp -up of \n2024 start -ups and the closing of the acquisitions of SapuraOMV in Malaysia and of interests in the Eagle Fo rd shale \ngas play in Texas that occurred during the fourth quarter 2024.  \n \nThe Integrated Power segment is expected to expand in 2025 supported by electricity production growth greater than \n20% to reach an annual net electricity generation of more than 50 TWh. Cash flow before working capital (CFFO) \nis expected to be between $2.5 and $3 billion in 2025.  \n \nBy combining hydrocarbon and electricity production growth, the Company expects to increase energy production \nby 5% in 2025. Integrated Power production wi ll represent 10% of hydrocarbon production.  \n \nFor 2025, TotalEnergies expects net investments of $17 to $17.5 billion, of which $4.5 billion is dedicated to low \ncarbon energies, mostly Integrated Power.

Acquisitions net of assets sales refer to acquisitions minus assets sales \n(including other operations with non -controlling interests).  This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, \nanalysts and shareholders alike because it illustrates the allocation of cash flow used for growing the Company’s \nasset base via external growth opportunities.  \nAdjusted EBITDA  (Earnings Before Int erest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) is a non -GAAP financial \nmeasure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Net Income. It refers to the adjusted earnings before \ndepreciation, depletion and impairment of tangible and intangible assets and m ineral interests, income tax expense \nand cost of net debt, i.e., all operating income and contribution of equity affiliates to net income. This indicator can \nbe a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to measure and compare the  Company’s \nprofitability with utility companies (energy sector).  \nAdjusted net income (TotalEnergies share)  is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable \nIFRS measure is Net Income (TotalEnergies share). Adjusted Net Income (TotalEnergies  share) refers to Net Income \n(TotalEnergies share) less adjustment items to Net Income (TotalEnergies share). Adjustment items are inventory \nvaluation effect, effect of changes in fair value, and special items. This indicator can be a valuable tool for dec ision \nmakers, analysts and shareholders alike to evaluate the Company’s operating results and to understand its operating \ntrends by removing the impact of non -operational results and special items.  \nAdjusted net operating income  is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure \nis Net Income. Adjusted Net Operating Income refers to Net Income before net cost of net debt, i.e., cost of net debt \nnet of its tax effects, less adjustment items. Adjustment i tems are inventory valuation effect, effect of changes in fair \nvalue, and special items. Adjusted Net Operating Income can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and \nshareholders alike to evaluate the Company’s operating results and understanding  its operating trends, by removing \nthe impact of non -operational results and special items and is used to evaluate the Return on Average Capital \nEmployed (ROACE) as explained below.  \nCapital Employed  is a non -GAAP financial measure. They are calculated at r eplacement cost and refer to capital \nemployed (balance sheet) less inventory valuations effect. Capital employed (balance sheet) refers to the sum of the \nfollowing items: (i) Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, net, (ii) Investments & loans i n equity affiliates, \n(iii) Other non -current assets, (iv) Working capital which is the sum of: Inventories, net, Accounts receivable, net, \nother current assets, Accounts payable, Other creditors and accrued liabilities(v) Provisions and other non -current \nliabilities and (vi) Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. Capital Employed can be a valuable tool for \ndecision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to provide insight on the amount of capital investment used by the \nCompany or its business segments to operate. Capital Employed is used to calculate the Return on Average Capital \nEmployed (ROACE).  \nCash Flow From Operations excluding working capital (CFFO)  is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most \ndirectly comparable IFRS measure is Cash flow  from operating activities. Cash Flow From Operations excluding \nworking capital is defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital at replacement \ncost, excluding the mark -to-market effect of Integrated LNG and Integrated Po wer contracts, including capital gain \nfrom renewable projects sales and including organic loan repayments from equity affiliates.  \nThis indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to help understand changes \nin cash  flow from operating activities, excluding the impact of working capital changes across periods on a consistent \nbasis and with the performance of peer companies in a manner that, when viewed in combination with the Company’s \nresults prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends \naffecting the Company’s business and performance. This performance indicator is used by the Company as a base \nfor its cash flow allocation and notably to guide on the share of its cash flow to be allocated to the distribution to \nshareholders.  \nDebt adjusted cash flow (DACF)  is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure \nis Cash flow from operating activities.

This indicator can be a valuable tool for \ndecision makers, analysts and shareholders as it provides the portion of the Cash Flow From Operations excluding \nworking capital distributed to the s hareholder.  \nReturn on Average Capital Employed (ROACE)  is a non -GAAP financial measure. ROACE is the ratio of \nAdjusted Net Operating Income to average Capital Employed at replacement cost between the beginning and the end \nof the period. This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to measure \nthe profitability of the Company’s average Capital Employed in its business operations and is used by the Company \nto benchmark its performance internally and externally with  its peers.  \nDisclaimer:  \nFinancial information by business segment is reported in accordance with the internal reporting system and shows \ninternal segment information that is used to manage and measure the performance of TotalEnergies. In addition to \nIFRS m easures, certain alternative performance indicators are presented, such as performance indicators excluding \nthe adjustment items described below (adjusted operating income, adjusted net operating income, adjusted net \nincome), return on equity (ROE), return  on average capital employed (ROACE), gearing ratio, operating cash flow \nbefore working capital changes, the shareholder rate of return. These indicators are meant to facilitate the analysis of \nthe financial performance of TotalEnergies and the comparison of income between periods. They allow investors to \ntrack the measures used internally to manage and measure the performance of TotalEnergies.  \nThese adjustment items include:  \n(i) Special items  \n \n41 Due to their unusual nature or particular significance, certain transactions qualifying as \"special items\" are excluded \nfrom the business segment figures. In general, special items relate to transactions that are significant, infrequent, or \nunusual. Howeve r, in certain instances, transactions such as restructuring costs or assets disposals, which are not \nconsidered to be representative of the normal course of business, may qualify as special items although they may \nhave occurred in prior years or are likely  to occur in following years.  \n(ii) The inventory valuation effect  \nIn accordance with IAS 2, TotalEnergies values inventories of petroleum products in its financial statements \naccording to the First -In, First -Out (FIFO) method and other inventories using t he weighted -average cost method. \nUnder the FIFO method, the cost of inventory is based on the historic cost of acquisition or manufacture rather than \nthe current replacement cost. In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on  the reported \nincome. Accordingly, the adjusted results of the Refining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services segments are \npresented according to the replacement cost method. This method is used to assess the segments’ performance and \nfacilitate the compara bility of the segments’ performance with those of its main competitors.  \nIn the replacement cost method, which approximates the Last -In, First -Out (LIFO) method, the variation of inventory \nvalues in the statement of income is, depending on the nature of the  inventory, determined using either the month -\nend prices differential between one period and another or the average prices of the period rather than the historical \nvalue. The inventory valuation effect is the difference between the results under the FIFO a nd the replacement cost \nmethods.  \n(iii) Effect of changes in fair value  \nThe effect of changes in fair value presented as an adjustment item reflects, for trading inventories and storage \ncontracts, differences between internal measures of performance used b y TotalEnergies’ Executive Committee and \nthe accounting for these transactions under IFRS.  \nIFRS requires that trading inventories be recorded at their fair value using period -end spot prices. In order to best \nreflect the management of economic exposure thr ough derivative transactions, internal indicators used to measure \nperformance include valuations of trading inventories based on forward prices.  \nTotalEnergies, in its trading activities, enters into storage contracts, whose future effects are recorded at fair value in \nTotalEnergies’ internal economic performance. IFRS precludes recognition of this fair value effect.  \nFurthermore, TotalEnergies enters into derivative instruments to risk manage certain operational contracts or assets. \nUnder IFRS, these deriva tives are recorded at fair value while the underlying operational transactions are recorded \nas they occur. Internal indicators defer the fair value on derivatives to match with the transaction occurrence.  \nThe adjusted results (adjusted operating income, a djusted net operating income, adjusted net income) are defined as \nreplacement cost results, adjusted for special items, excluding the effect of changes in fair value.  \nEuro amounts presented for the fully adjusted -diluted earnings per share represent dollar  amounts converted at the \naverage euro -dollar (€ -$) exchange rate for the applicable period and are not the result of financial statements \nprepared in euros.  \nRenewable Power: TotalEnergies Will Supply 1.5 TWh to STMicroelectronics in France Over 15 years  \nParis, January 28, 2025 - Paris, Geneva – January 28, 2025 – TotalEnergies and STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM), \na global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, have signed a \nphysical1 Power Purchase Agreement t o supply renewable electricity to STMicroelectronics sites in France.

When sanctions shut Russian diesel out \nof Europe, SATORP delivered around 300 000 tons of diesel to France, which has made it possible to guarantee \nFrance's security  of supply.  \nAMIRAL: an $11 billion petrochemical complex  \nThe construction of the Amiral petrochemical complex, which benefits from synergies with the SATORP platform, \nis already a third of the way through in line with its initial schedule, which is schedul ed to start in 2027. The Amiral \nproject alone, jointly developed by Aramco (62.5%) and TotalEnergies (37.5%), represents an investment of about \n$11 billion.  \nSolar: our multi -energy strategy to serve the Kingdom's objectives  \nTotalEnergies is currently build ing the Wadi Al Dawasir solar power plant (119 MW) with its partners Toyota \nTshusho (40%) and Al Taqaa Zahid (40%). It will be connected to the grid and operational at the beginning of 2025.  \nIn addition, the consortium composed of TotalEnergies and Saudi developer Aljomaih Energy and Water Company \n(AEW) has signed, in November 2024, a 25 -year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Saudi Power Procurement \nCompany (SPPC) for the Rabigh 2 solar project (300 MW). The solar power plant will  be developed, built, owned \nand operated by the consortium with a grid connection planned for 2026.  \nFinally, TotalEnergies is developing smaller -scale solar projects through its 50% -owned subsidiary Safeer with Al \nTaqa Zahid for industrial and commercial c ustomers.  \nSustainable aviation fuels (SAF) : a production unit under study  \nAfter successful tests carried out in 2024, Aramco and TotalEnergies have embarked on a project to co -process used \ncooking oil to produce sustainable aviation fuels at SATORP from 2 026. \nIn addition, Aramco, TotalEnergies and Saudi Investment Recycling Company (SIRC) are assessing the development \nof a sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) production unit in synergy with SATORP.  \nThis collaboration will draw on the expertise of the three par tners to develop a production unit of sustainable aviation \nfuels by converting local residues from the circular economy, such as used cooking oil and animal fats.  \n \n47 TotalEnergies’ Statement on its Investments related to Adani Group in India  \nParis, November 25, 2024 – TotalEnergies has learnt through public announcements made by the US authorities of \nthe indictment of certain individual Adani group executives in relation to an alleged corruption scheme linked to the \nbusiness of Adani Green Energy Limited (AGE L). This indictment does not target AGEL itself, nor any AGEL \nrelated companies.  \nIn accordance with its code of conduct, TotalEnergies rejects corruption in any form.  \nTotalEnergies, which is not targeted nor involved in the facts described by such indictme nt, will take all relevant \nactions to protect its interests as minority (19.75%) shareholder of AGEL and as a joint -venture partner (50%) in \nproject companies with AGEL.  \nUntil such time when the accusations against the Adani group individuals and their con sequences have been clarified, \nTotalEnergies will not make any new financial contribution as part of its investments in the Adani group of \ncompanies.  \nTotalEnergies recalls that its investments in Adani’s entities were undertaken in full compliance with app licable \nlaws, and with TotalEnergies’ own internal governance processes pursuant to due diligence and representations made \nby the sellers. In particular, TotalEnergies was not made aware of the existence of an investigation into the alleged \ncorruption sche me. \nTotalEnergies’ investments in and with AGEL  \nIn January 2021 TotalEnergies acquired a minority interest in the listed company Adani Green Energy Limited of \nwhich it now owns 19,75%. As part of its strategy to enhance its development in renewables in Ind ia through direct \naccess to a portfolio of assets, TotalEnergies also has acquired 50% stake in 3 JVs operating renewable assets \n(AGEL23 in 2020, AREL9 in 2023, AREL64 in 2024).  \nHydrogen: TotalEnergies Accelerates Decarbonization of its Platform at La Mède  \nParis, November 25, 2024 – In line with its 2030 ambition to decarbonize the hydrogen used in its European \nrefineries, TotalEnergies has joined forces with Air Liquide to produce renewable hydrogen at La Mède in southeast \nFrance. This new project compleme nts the Masshylia project to produce green hydrogen by electrolysis led by \nTotalEnergies in partnership with ENGIE. These projects will reduce the La Mède biorefinery’s CO2 annual \nemissions by 130,000 tons.  \nRenewable hydrogen for biofuels production, with Air Liquide  \nAir Liquide is going to build and operate a renewable hydrogen production unit at the La Mède platform. With an \nannual capacity of 25,000 tons, this unit will recycle coproducts from the TotalEnergies biorefinery. The hydrogen \nwill then be used  in the biorefinery to produce biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).  \nThe project’s total investment amounts to € 150 million for TotalEnergies and Air Liquide. The new unit is expected \nto start production in 2028.  \n“This new renewable hydrogen prod uction project, carried out with Air Liquide, allows us to accelerate the \ndecarbonization of our La Mède platform. Almost ten years after the announcement of its conversion, La Mède is \ncontinuing its transformation and is becoming a low -carbon hydrogen pro duction center, thus contributing to the \ndecarbonization ambition of the Provence -Alpes -Côte -D’Azur region.”, said Vincent Stoquart, President, Refining \n& Chemicals at TotalEnergies.  \nAt the same time, TotalEnergies is continuing the development, with its p artner ENGIE, of the Masshylia project of \ngreen hydrogen production by water electrolysis with a capacity of 10,000 tons per year, to contribute to the \ndecarbonization of both the biorefinery and local customers at the Fos -Berre industrial -port zone. The t wo partners \nare aiming to start up the first 20 MW electrolyser in 2029, subject to confirmation of European and French subsidies \nand the necessary public authorizations.  \nTotalEnergies and the decarbonization of its European refineries  \nTotalEnergies is com mitted to reducing the carbon footprint of producing, converting and supplying energy to its \ncustomers. One of the paths identified by the Company is to use low -carbon hydrogen to decarbonize its European \nrefineries, a move that should help reduce its CO2 emissions by around three million tons a year by 2030.  \n \n48 COP29: TotalEnergies and Oil India Join Forces to Collaborate on Methane Emissions Detection and \nMeasurement  \nParis, November 19, 2024 – TotalEnergies and Oil India Limited (OIL) signed a Cooperation Agreement to carry \nout methane emissions detection and measurement campaigns using TotalEnergies’ pioneer AUSEA technology at \nOIL sites in India.  \nState -owned enterprise OIL recently joined the  Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter (OGDC), a global industry \ninitiative launched at COP28, co -chaired by TotalEnergies’ CEO. The OGDC’s ambition is to work towards net -zero \noperations by 2050, as well as near -zero upstream methane emissions and zero rout ine flaring by 2030. Moreover, \nOGDC members are committed to measuring and publicly reporting progress.  \nIn line with the OGDC’s principle of sharing good practices, TotalEnergies makes this technology available to other \noperators among the signatories, as an effective and recognized tool to detect, measure and eventually abate methane \nemissions on their own assets.  \nAUSEA, a one -of-a-kind technology by TotalEnergies  \nMounted on a drone, the AUSEA gas analyzer, developed by TotalEnergies and its R&D partners, consists of a dual \nsensor capable of detecting methane and carbon dioxide emissions, while at the same time identifying their source. \nThis technology marks a step change in methane emissions detection and measurement compared to traditional \ntechn iques. By allowing access to hard -to-reach emission points, on all types of industrial facilities, both offshore \nand onshore, AUSEA is reputed as one of the most accurate technologies in the industry.  \n“We are delighted that OIL has joined the growing list of national companies we are collaborating with by making \nour AUSEA technology available. This is a clear demonstration that the Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter launched \nat COP28 has gained momentum, thanks to the promotion of industrial best practices. Today, AUSEA performs \ncampaigns on every continent and contributes to the OGDC signatories’ ambition to aim at near -zero upstream \nmethane emissions by 2030”, said Patrick Pouyanné Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.  \nCommenting on the pact, Dr. Ranjit Rath, Chairman & Managing Director of OIL, said “By joining our peers in the \nOGDC, OIL reiterates India’s commitment to the global community, while underscoring OIL's dedication to reducing \nemissions. OIL is pleased to be collaborating with TotalEnergies, an ind ustry pioneer in methane emissions detection \nand measurements”.  \nCOP29: TotalEnergies, bp, Equinor and Shell join forces to help increase access to energy  \nParis -London -Stavanger, November 15, 2024 – TotalEnergies, bp, Equinor and Shell announce a commitment  to \ninvest in support of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (UN SDG7), which aims to ensure access to affordable, \nreliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. The four energy majors have come together with a $500 million joint \ninvestment commitment , intended to create positive energy access impact for people in key regions over the coming \nyears.  \nA growing number of people without access to electricity and clean cooking  \nDespite ongoing efforts, progress towards universal energy access has stalled, pa rticularly amidst recent \nmacroeconomic shocks and rising energy prices. In 2022, the number of people without access to electricity globally \nincreased by around 10 million to 685 million. Additionally, approximately 2.1 billion people, primarily in sub -\nSaharan Africa and Southeast Asia, lack access to clean cooking facilities, disproportionately impacting women and \ngirls who often bear the brunt of domestic responsibilities.  \nJoint efforts to support energy access in Sub -Saharan Africa, South and Southeast A sia \nbp, Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies decided to join forces to help address the challenges of energy access. With \n$500 million of committed capital, the joint investment seeks to support promising, high -impact projects, primarily \nin Sub -Saharan Africa,  South and Southeast Asia, aiming to help millions of people in underserved communities \ngain access to electricity and improved cooking conditions. Their shared intent is for the committed capital to be \ninvested in a broad range of solutions, including sol ar home systems, mini/metro grids, clean cooking solutions, and \nenabling technologies (such as e -mobility, energy storage and management solutions). Over the coming years this \nhas the potential to support UN SDG 7 while also generating co -benefits like job  creation and improved health \noutcomes.  \n \n49 A global private equity firm with a strong track record in impact investing, has been selected to manage the joint \ninvestment. Their expertise will support the investments being strategically directed to create both social impact and \nfinancial returns, while engaging with governments, international organizations, financial institutions, the private \nsector, civil society, and philanthropies. This includes sharing learnings, providing technical assistance, and \naddressin g market barriers.  \nPatrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies commented: “At TotalEnergies, we are deeply committed \nto making energy accessible to all. Around a third of our development in electricity in the coming years will be in \nemerging countr ies, which will enable about 40 million people to benefit from access to electricity. Furthermore, we \nare committed to investing 400 million dollars in Liquefied Petroleum Gas facilities to develop clean cooking \nsolutions in Africa and India, which will he lp 100 million people access healthier, more sustainable and more reliable \nenergy. With this new joint initiative with our peers, we are activating another lever to contribute to high -impact \nlocal projects to help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Dev elopment Goal 7 by 2030.”  \nMurray Auchincloss, CEO of bp commented: “It is early days, but we hope that by jointly investing, we will be able \nto contribute to wider efforts to tackle the very real challenge of access to energy. Over time, we believe it can help \nto create a more inclusive energy future for some of the many millions of people who lack that access today.”  \nAnders Opedal, President and CEO of Equinor commented: “This joint investment brings together four leading \nenergy companies investing in emer ging countries. We believe this effort will help close some of the energy access \ngaps, which is a key part in reaching the global ambition of a just and equitable energy transition.”  \nWael Sawan, CEO of Shell commented: “We want to support accelerated progr ess towards universal energy access \nas we believe it has the power to transform lives. This joint investment will help to do that. By working collectively \nto overcome key energy access challenges we can achieve sustained impact and drive real change.”  \nCOP2 9: TotalEnergies deploys continuous, real -time methane emissions detection equipment on all its operated \nupstream assets  \nParis, November 14, 2024 – As part of its ambition to aim for near -zero methane emissions by 2030, TotalEnergies \nannounces that the Com pany is going a step further in the monitoring and reduction of its methane emissions with \nthe deployment of continuous, real -time detection equipment at all of its operated Upstream sites.  \nSetting a new standard in monitoring of methane emissions  \nSince 20 22, TotalEnergies has been pursuing its ambition to aim for near -zero methane operated emissions in 2030: \nthe Company will meet as soon as 2024 its target to reduce emissions by 50% compared to 2020, a year ahead of \nplan. TotalEnergies is thus well on trac k to achieve the targeted 80% reduction by 2030. This achievement is the \nresult of numerous initiatives, including the successful deployment of its AUSEA1 drone campaigns.  \nComplementing its portfolio of detection technologies already in place, TotalEnergie s is going a step further by \ninstalling continuous detection equipment on all its operated Upstream assets, enabling real -time identification of \nmethane emissions, both fugitive and stationary, and immediate corrective actions to stop them.  \nThis continuous  detection plan will be fully implemented by end -2025 and will use existing and proven technologies \nsuch as loT2 sensors, InfraRed cameras, flowmeters and Predictive Emissions Monitoring Systems on combustion \nsources.  \nContinuous, real -time detection on thi s scale - both for existing facilities and projects under development, such as \nthe GranMorgu FPSO in Suriname – is a pioneering move in the industry and sets a new standard for the Company.  \n“Slashing down methane emissions is a short -term priority to contr ibute to the fight against climate change. \nContinuous, real -time detection will enable our operators to act in an even more decisive manner in order to reduce \nour methane emissions and to repair leaks to achieve our near -zero methane emissions ambition. As  a champion of \nthe Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter (OGDC), I am proud that TotalEnergies is leading the way in deploying such \nequipment at large scale and we will continue to work with the industry to share best practices in measuring and \nfighting methan e emissions”, said Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.  \n(1)  Airborne Ultralight Spectrometer for Environmental Applications  \n(2) Internet of Things  \n \n50 GENERAL INFORMATION  \n(a) Paragraph (1) in the “ General Information ” section of the Debt Issuance Programme Prospectus on page \n214 entitled “ Consents, Approvals and Authorisations in connection with the Programme ” is hereby deleted \nand replaced in its entirety with the following:  \nEach of TotalEnergies SE , TotalEnergies Capital  and TotalEnergie s Capital International has obtained all \nnecessary consents, approvals and authorisations in France in connection with the update of the Programme \nand the issuance of Notes under the Programme and (in respect of Senior Notes issued by TotalEnergies \nCapital  and TotalEnergies Capital International) the guarantees relating to the Notes and the Programme.  \n(i) For the purpose of the giving of the guarantees, Patrick Pouyanné ( the Président Directeur \nGénéral ) (who in turn delegated to Jean -Pierre Sbraire ( Directeur financier ) and Denis Toulouse  \n(Trésorier )) of TotalEnergies SE  benefits from an authority granted by the Conseil \nd’Administration  of TotalEnergies SE  dated 11 December 2024 , to grant guarantees up to a \nmaximum aggregate amount of €100 billion whi ch authority will expire on 31 December 2025 . \n(ii) Any issue of Notes by each of TotalEnergies SE , TotalEnergies Capital and TotalEnergies Capital \nInternational under the Programme will, to the extent that such Notes constitute obligations  under \nFrench law, req uire the prior authorisation of its Conseil d’Administration , unless its Statuts  grant \nsuch power to the shareholders’ meeting or the latter decides to exercise such power.
