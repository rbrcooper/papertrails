This \nscenario enables us to present the expected evolution of the energy system up to 2050 in line with current trends a nd \nthe efforts still required to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement.  \nAccess to energy essential to meet development needs  \nToday, around 4.5 billion people have access to a level of energy that is below what is deemed necessary for \nsatisfactory human development, particularly in terms of access to healthcare and education.  \nDemographic forecasts indicate that the world's population will increase by 1.7 billion by 2050, in India and the \nGlobal South. Ensuring sufficient access to energ y for the world's entire population today requires tripling the energy \navailable in the least developed countries. Taking into account their expected population growth, by 2050 they will \nneed four times more energy than today. Our collective challenge is t herefore to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nwhile responding to the legitimate demand for more energy for the population of emerging countries.  \nAn energy transition underway but which ought to be accelerated  \nSince 2000, we have experienced a decoupling between GDP growth and energy demand growth. Electricity has \ngrown faster than the other energies, and renewables have accelerated their growth since 2015. However, demand \nfor coal, which is often domestic and inexpensive, continues to grow, and  energy intensity gains (1.4% per year \nobserved over 2000 -2022) remain below the ambition set at COP28 (3% to 4% per year).  \nAnalysis by geographical zone shows that rising living standards, particularly in India and China, are the main drivers \nof the incre ase in energy demand in recent years.  \nTwo major developments occurred in the last 20 years that will shape the energy transition: the shale gas and oil \nrevolution in the United States has transformed the energy landscape in the United States and around the  world; and \na few low -carbon technologies, in particular solar panels and electric vehicles, have made sufficient progress to be \ndeployed on a large scale and be cost -competitive for consumers, provided that, at the same time, electricity networks \nreceive sufficient investment.  \n3 scenarios for the next thirty years  \nThe Trends scenario reflects the current trajectory of the various countries up to 2030 and incorporates our \nanticipation of future technological and public policy developments in line with curre nt trends. It accounts for the \nrecent acceleration in the penetration of mature decarbonization technologies: solar and wind power to produce \nelectricity, electric vehicles and heat pumps to use it, particularly in China. However, infrastructure constraint s (in \nparticular electricity grids) and geopolitical tensions are limiting their large -scale deployment. This scenario yields \nan estimated temperature increase between +2.6° and +2.7°C by 2100.  \nTotalEnergies' Momentum scenario is a forward -looking approach  integrating the decarbonization strategies of NZ50 \ncountries, as well as the NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) of other countries. It implies: (i) electrification \nof final demand in NZ50 countries and China, (ii) phasing -out coal in NZ50 countrie s, a sharp reduction in China \nand only slight growth in this energy source in the Global South countries, (iii) the use of natural gas as a transitional \nenergy source for electricity and industry in all countries, and (iv) the deployment of new energies in  non-electrifiable \nsectors (e.g. decarbonized hydrogen in industry and transport, sustainable fuels in aviation and marine) in NZ50 \ncountries and China  .In this scenario, fossil fuels still cover half of the growth in energy demand in the Global South, \n \n21 due to insufficient low -carbon investment. This scenario yields an estimated temperature increase between +2.2° and \n+2.3°C by 2100.  \nRupture is a normative scenario designed to achieve a temperature increase of less than 2°C by 2100. For example, \nmoving from T rends to Rupture requires an 80% increase in installed solar and wind power capacity in India and the \nGlobal South by 2030. Beyond 2040, all decarbonization levers are applied globally, in particular the deployment of \nnew energies and CCUS. In this scenari o, decarbonized technologies are deployed globally according to their merit \ncurve. This scenario yields an estimated temperature increase between +1.7° and +1.8°C by 2100.  \nTo move from Trends to Rupture, the world should collectively give priority to exist ing technologies offering an \nacceptable abatement cost. In particular, public decision -makers should step up international cooperation to ensure \nthat the cheapest technologies are available globally, and that financial instruments adapted to developing cou ntries \nare deployed.  \n\"To keep pace with the growth in energy demand which is essential to the legitimate improvement in the standard of \nliving of the emerging countries’ population while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions, public \npolicies and  the players in the energy chain must give priority to mature and sufficiently affordable low -carbon \ntechnologies and cooperate to deploy them across the globe. This is the way to combine economic and social \ndevelopment with the acceleration of the energy transition,\" said Aurélien Hamelle, Managing Director Strategy & \nSustainability.  \nChina: TotalEnergies will supply 2 million ton s of LNG per year to Sinopec for 15 years  \n4 November 2024 - As part of its Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) business growth strategy, T otalEnergies today \nannounced the signing of a sales agreement (HoA) with Sinopec for the delivery of 2 million tons of LNG per year \nfor 15 years, starting in 2028.  \nWith this major agreement with one of the country's leading LNG players, TotalEnergies is st rengthening its long -\nterm positions in the LNG market in China, the world's largest market. This agreement is part of the strategic \ncooperation agreement signed earlier this year between TotalEnergies and Sinopec on the occasion of President Xi \nJinping's s tate visit to France. In China, natural gas is a vector of the energy transition because it compensates for the \nintermittency of fast -growing renewable energies and helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions when it replaces coal \nin electricity production.  \n“We are delighted to have been chosen by Sinopec to supply 2 million tonnes of LNG to China, the world's largest \nLNG importing country. This new agreement demonstrates the competitiveness of TotalEnergies' LNG business and \nallows us to continue to grow our sa les in Asia in the long term, ” said Stéphane Michel, President Renewable Gases \n& Power at TotalEnergies.  \nMr. Niu Shuanwen, Senior Vice President of Sinopec Corporation, said, “Sinopec and TotalEnergies are strategic \npartners. This agreement in principle st rengthens the cooperation between the two companies in the field of natural \ngas. Natural gas is an important enabler of the energy transition and the achievement of the twin objectives of peak \nand carbon neutrality. Sinopec is committed to becoming the wor ld's leading clean energy and chemical production \ncompany and will continue to promote the energy transition as well as the clean, diversified and secure supply of \nenergy. Sinopec strives to contribute positively to global energy governance and climate cha nge.” \nTotalEnergies announces the third interim dividend of €0.79/share for  fiscal year  2024 , an increase close to  \n7% compared to 2023  \n31 October 2024  - The Board of Directors, meeting on October 30, 2024 under the chairmanship of Mr. Patrick \nPouyanné, Cha irman and Chief Executive Officer, decided to distribute a third interim dividend for the 2024 financial \nyear in the amount of €0.79/share, an increase of 6.8% compared to the interim dividends paid for the 2023 financial \nyear and identical to the first an d second interim dividends for the 2024 financial year. This increase is in line with \nthe shareholder return policy for the year 2024 as confirmed by the Board of Directors in February 2024 and reiterated \nat the Annual General Meeting on May 24, 2024This i nterim dividend will be detached and paid in cash only, \naccording to the following schedule:  \n   Shareholders  ADS holders  \nEx-dividend date  March 26, 2025  March 25, 2025  \nPayment in cash  April 1, 2025  April 16, 2025  \n \n22 Third quarter 2024 results: TotalEnergies proves resiliency in a volatile oil environment thanks to its \nintegrated model with $4.1B adjusted net income for the 3rd quarter and $13.9B for the first 9 months of the \nyear  \n \n31 October 2024 - The Board of Directors of TotalEnergies SE, chaired by CEO Patrick Pouyanné, met on October \n30, 2024, to approve the third quarter 2024 financial statements. On the occasion, Patrick Pouyanné said:  \n“In a volatile oil environment with sharply declining refining margins, TotalEnergies demonstrates the resilience  of \nits integrated multi -energy model with $4.1 billion adjusted net income and $6.8 billion CFFO in the third quarter \nof 2024.  \nThis resilience is firstly underpinned by Exploration & Production, posting solid adjusted net operating income of \n$2.5 billion,  down only 7%, stable cash flow of $4.3 billion and an attractive return on capital employed of 15.6%. \nDuring the third quarter, Upstream production was 2.41 Mboe/d, benefiting from the ramp up of Mero 2 in Brazil \nthat partially offset production losses at  Ichtys LNG and in Libya. In the third quarter, TotalEnergies commenced \nproduction from the high -margin Anchor oil project in the US, as well as from the Fenix gas project in Argentina. \nThe Company also launched the GranMorgu project in Suriname, which wil l support its production growth target \nof 3%/year through 2030.  \nIntegrated LNG achieved adjusted net operating income of $1.1 billion and cash flow of $0.9 billion, with gas and \nLNG trading not fully benefiting from markets characterized by low volatility.  TotalEnergies continues to strengthen \nfuture cash flows by successfully marketing its LNG volumes through signing several medium -term sales contracts \nin Asia this quarter.  \nGiven the very sharp decrease in refining margins in Europe ( -66% quarter -to-quarte r) and in the Rest of the World, \nDownstream posted adjusted net operating income of $0.6 billion and cash flow of $1.2 billion, down around 40% \nquarter -to-quarter, with marketing and trading activities compensating for the very sharp decline in refining.  \nIntegrated Power also contributes to the resilience of the Company’s results, with reported adjusted net operating \nincome of $0.5 billion and cash flow of more than $0.6 billion. Year -to-date cash flow is strong at  \n____  \n(1)  Refer to “Glossary ” below for the definitions and further information on alternative performance measures (Non -GAAP measures) and to \n“10.

Results  \n \nExploration  & Production  adjusted  net operating  income  was $2,482  million  in the third  quarter  2024,  down  7% \nquarter -to-quarter, driven by the decrease in liquid prices that was partially compensated by an increase in gas prices.  \nCash  flow from  operations  excluding  working  capital  (CFFO)  was $4,273  million  in the third  quarter  2024,  down 2% \nquarter -to-quarter.  \n__ \n(15)  Effective tax rate = (tax on adjusted net operating income) / (adjusted net operating income – income from equity affiliates – dividends received from \ninvestments – impairment of goodwill + tax on adjusted net operating income).  \n \n28 4.2. Integrated LNG  \n4.2.1. Production  \n \nHydrocarbon production for LNG in the third quarter 2024 was down 7% quarter -to-quarter, notably linked to \nunplanned maintenance on Ichthys LNG.  \nLNG sales increased by 8% quarter -to-quarter, notably due to higher spot volumes, in a context of seasonal inve ntory \nreplenishment.  \n4.2.2. Results  \n \nIntegrated LNG adjusted net operating income was $1,063 million in the third quarter 2024, down 8% quarter - to-\nquarter, mainly due to lower hydrocarbon production for LNG. Moreover, gas trading did not fully benefit fr om \nmarkets characterized by low volatility.  \nCash flow from operations excluding working capital (CFFO) was $888 million in the third quarter 2024, down 27% \nquarter -to-quarter, for the same reasons and due to a timing effect in dividend payments from some e quity affiliates \nof around $200 million.  \n\n \n29 4.3. Integrated Power  \n4.3.1. Productions, capacities, clients and sales  \n \nNet power production was 11.1 TWh in the third quarter 2024, up 23% quarter -to-quarter mainly due to higher \nproduction from flexible gas assets in the United States and the acquisition of the West Burton gas -fired power plant \nin the United Kingdom.  \nGross installed renewable power generation capacity reached 24.2 GW at the end of the third quarter 2024, up 0.2 \nGW quarter -to-quarter.  \n4.3.2. Results  \n \nIntegrated Power adjusted net operating income and cash flow from operations excluding working capital (CFFO) \nwere stable in the third quarter 2024 at $485 million and $636 million, respectively. This demonstrates the v alue of \nthe Company’s integrated business model along the power value chain, with all segments (renewables, flexible assets, \nmarketing to customers) contributing positively to the results.  \nCash flow from operations excluding working capital (CFFO) was $1,9 51 million for the nine first months of 2024, \nup 35% year -on-year, in line with the growth of the business.  \n\n \n30 4.4.

Adjusted net operating income from business segments  \nAdjusted net operating income from business segments was:  \n• $4,635 million in the third quarter 2024 versus $5,339 million in the second quarter 2024, mainly due to \nmuch lower re fining margins and the decrease in oil prices,  \n• $15,574 million in the first nine months of 2024 versus $19,383 million in the first nine months of 2023, \nlinked to lower gas and LNG prices and, for the third quarter, lower refining margins.  \n5.2. Adjusted ne t income(1) (TotalEnergies share)  \nTotalEnergies adjusted net income was $4,074 million in the third quarter 2024 versus $4,672 million in the second \nquarter 2024, mainly due to much lower refining margins and the decrease in oil prices.  \nAdjusted net income  excludes the after -tax inventory effect, special items and the impact of changes in fair value.  \nAdjustments to net income were ($1,780) million in the third quarter 2024, consisting mainly of:  \n• ($1.1) billion related to impairments, notably linked to the C hapter 11 bankruptcy filing of Sunpower and \nthe exit of blocks 11B/12B and 5/6/7 in South Africa,  \n• ($0.4) billion in inventory effects,  \n• ($0.3) billion in other adjustments, notably related to the effect of changes in fair value and adjustments of \ndeferred t ax assets linked to changes in tax rates.  \nTotalEnergies’ average tax rate was:  \n• 38.0% in the third quarter 2024 versus 40.4% in the second quarter 2024,  \n• 38.7% in the first nine months of 2024 versus 37.5% a year ago, notably due to a higher weight of \nExplor ation & Production in the Company’s results.  \n5.3. Adjusted earnings per share  \nAdjusted diluted net earnings per share were:  \n• $1.74 in the third quarter 2024, based on 2,310 million weighted average diluted shares, compared to $1.98 \nin the second quarter 2024,  \n• $5.87 in the first nine months of 2024, based on 2,327 million weighted average diluted shares, compared \nto $7.24 a year ago.  \nAs of September 30, 2024, the number of diluted shares was 2,299 million. TotalEnergies repurchased*:  \n• 29.3 million s hares in the third quarter 2024 for $2 billion,  \n• 88.1 million shares in the first nine months of 2024 for $6 billion.  \n__ \n*  Including coverage of employee share grant plans.  \n \n33 5.4. Acquisitions – asset sales  \nAcquisitions were:  \n• $1,795 million in the third quarter 2024, primarily related to the acquisition of the West Burton flexible gas \ncapacity in the United Kingdom, acquisitions of stakes in offshore wind projects in Germany in 2023 and \nin the Netherlands in 2024 and investment in a new solar portfo lio with Adani Green in India.  \n• $3,413 million in the first nine months of 2024, related to the above elements as well as the acquisitions of \na 20% interest from Lewis Energy Group in the Dorado (Eagle Ford) gas field in the United States, the \nGerman renewa ble energy aggregator Quadra Energy, 1.5 GW of flexible gas capacity in Texas, battery \nstorage developer Kyon in Germany, and Talos Low Carbon Solutions in the carbon storage industry in the \nUnited States.  \nDivestments were:  \n• $133 million in the third quarte r 2024, primarily related to earn -out payments from the sale of upstream \nCanadian oil assets,  \n• $2,031 million in the first nine months of 2024, related to the above elements as well as to the closing of \nthe retail network transaction with Alimentation Couch e-Tard in Belgium, Luxemburg, and the Netherlands, \nthe sale of a 15% interest in Absheron, in Azerbaijan, the farmdown of the Seagreen offshore wind farm in \nthe United Kingdom, and the sale of petrochemical assets in Lavera, France.  \n5.5. Net cash flow(1) \nTotalEnergies' net cash flow was:  \n• $1,057 million in the third quarter 2024 compared to $3,147 million in the second quarter 2024, reflecting \nthe $956 million decrease in CFFO and the $1,134 million increase in net investments to $5,764 million in \nthe third quarter 2024,  \n• $8,800 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $11,344 million a year ago, reflecting the \n$4,680 million decrease in CFFO and the $2,136 million decrease in net investments to $13,966 million in \nthe first nine months of 2024.  \n2024 third quarter cash flow from operating activities was $7,171 million versus CFFO of $6,821 million, and was \nimpacted by an improvement in working capital of $0.4 billion, mainly due to the stock effect at the end of the quarter \nthat was partiall y compensated by the decrease of tax payables.  \n5.6. Profitability  \nReturn on equity was 16.6% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024.  \n \nReturn on average capital employed(1) was 14.6% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024.  \n \n\n \n34 6. TotalEnergies SE statutory accounts  \nNet income  for TotalEnergies  SE, the parent  company,  amounted  to: \n• €4,336  million  in the third  quarter  2024,  compared  to €1,348  million  in the third  quarter  2023,  \n• €12,331  million  in the first nine months  of 2024,  compared  to €8,388  million  in the first nine months  of 2023.  \n7. Annual 2024 Sensitivities(16) \n \n8. Outlook  \nIn a context of modest global macroeconomic growth and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, oil prices are \nvolatile. At the end of October, the European Refining Marker (ERM) is close to 25 $/t, compared to an average of \n15$/t in the third quarter.  \nEuropean gas prices remain at sustained levels and are expected to be between $12 and $13/Mbtu in the fourth quarter \n2024, supported by th e anticipation of winter gas consumption. Given the evolution of oil and gas prices in the recent \nmonths and the lag effect on price formulas, TotalEnergies anticipates that its average LNG selling price should be \naround $10/Mbtu in the fourth quarter 2024 . \nFourth quarter 2024 hydrocarbon production is expected to be between 2.4 and 2.45 Mboe/d, benefiting from the end \nof security -related disruptions in Libya and the start -up of the Mero -3 project in Brazil, which are compensated by \nseveral planned shutdown s during the fourth quarter of 2024.  \nThe fourth quarter 2024 refining utilization rate is anticipated to remain above 85%, with a turnaround planned at \nLeuna refinery in October.  \nThe Company confirms net investments guidance of $17 -$18 billion in 2024.  \n__ \n(16)  Sensitivities are revised once per year upon publication of the previous year’s fourth quarter results. Sensitivities are est imates based on assumptions about \nTotalEnergies’ portfolio in 2024. Actual results could vary significantly from estimates  based on the application of these sensitivities. The impact of the $ -€ \nsensitivity on adjusted net operating income is essentially attributable to Refining & Chemicals.  \n(17)  In a 80 $/b Brent environment.  \n \n35 9.

Payout  \n \nGlossary  \nAcquisitions net of assets sales  is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure \nis Cash flow used in investing activities. Acquisitions net of assets sales refer to acquisitions minus assets sales \n(including other operations with non - controlling interests). This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, \nanalysts and shareholders alike because it illustrates the allocation of cash flow used for growing the Company’s \nasset base via external g rowth opportunities.  \nAdjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) is a non -GAAP financial \nmeasure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Net Income. It refers to the adjusted earnings before \ndepreciation, depleti on and impairment of tangible and intangible assets and mineral interests, income tax expense \nand cost of net debt, i.e., all operating income and contribution of equity affiliates to net income. This indicator can \nbe a valuable tool for decision makers, a nalysts and shareholders alike to measure and compare the Company’s \nprofitability with utility companies (energy sector).  \nAdjusted net income (TotalEnergies share) is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable \nIFRS measure is Net Income (TotalEnergies share). Adjusted Net Income (TotalEnergies share) refers to Net Income \n(TotalEnergies share) less adjustment items to Net Income (TotalEnergies share). Adjustment items are inventory \nvaluation effect, effect of changes in fair value, and spe cial items. This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision \nmakers, analysts and shareholders alike to evaluate the Company’s operating results and to understand its operating \ntrends by removing the impact of non -operational results and special items.  \nAdjusted net operating income is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure \nis Net Income. Adjusted Net Operating Income refers to Net Income before net cost of net debt, i.e., cost of net debt \nnet of its tax effects, less ad justment items. Adjustment items are inventory valuation effect, effect of changes in fair \nvalue, and special items. Adjusted Net Operating Income can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and \nshareholders alike to evaluate the Company’s operati ng results and understanding its operating trends, by removing \nthe impact of non -operational results and special items and is used to evaluate the Return on Average Capital \nEmployed (ROACE) as explained below.  \nCapital Employed is a non -GAAP financial measu re. They are calculated at replacement cost and refer to capital \nemployed (balance sheet) less inventory valuations effect. Capital employed (balance sheet) refers to the sum of the \nfollowing items: (i) Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, net , (ii) Investments & loans in equity affiliates, \n(iii) Other non -current assets, (iv) Working capital which is the sum of: Inventories, net, Accounts receivable, net, \nother current assets, Accounts payable, Other creditors and accrued liabilities(v) Provis ions and other non -current \nliabilities and (vi) Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. Capital Employed can be a valuable tool for \ndecision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to provide insight on the amount of capital investment used by the \n\n \n42 Company or its business segments to operate. Capital Employed is used to calculate the Return on Average Capital \nEmployed (ROACE).  \nCash Flow From Operations excluding working capital (CFFO) is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most \ndirectly comparab le IFRS measure is Cash flow from operating activities. Cash Flow From Operations excluding \nworking capital is defined as cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital at replacement \ncost, excluding the mark -to-market effect of Inte grated LNG and Integrated Power contracts, including capital gain \nfrom renewable projects sales and including organic loan repayments from equity affiliates.  \nThis indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to help  understand changes \nin cash flow from operating activities, excluding the impact of working capital changes across periods on a consistent \nbasis and with the performance of peer companies in a manner that, when viewed in combination with the Company’s \nresults prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends \naffecting the Company’s business and performance. This performance indicator is used by the Company as a base \nfor its cash flow allocation and notably to  guide on the share of its cash flow to be allocated to the distribution to \nshareholders.  \nDebt adjusted cash flow (DACF) is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure \nis Cash flow from operating activities. DACF is defined a s Cash Flow From Operations excluding working capital \n(CFFO) without financial charges. This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and \nshareholders alike because it corresponds to the funds theoretically available to the Company fo r investments, debt \nrepayment and distribution to shareholders, and therefore facilitates comparison of the Company’s results of \noperations with those of other registrants, independent of their capital structure and working capital requirements.  \nFree cash flow after Organic Investments is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS \nmeasure is Cash flow from operating activities. Free cash flow after Organic Investments, refers to Cash Flow From \nOperations excluding working capital min us Organic Investments. Organic Investments refer to Net Investments \nexcluding acquisitions, asset sales and other transactions with non -controlling interests. This indicator can be a \nvaluable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike becau se it illustrates operating cash flow generated \nby the business post allocation of cash for Organic Investments.  \nGearing  is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is the ratio of total \nfinancial liabilities to total equi ty. Gearing is a Net -debt-to-capital ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of Net debt \nexcluding leases to (Equity + Net debt excluding leases). This indicator can be a valuable tool for decision makers, \nanalysts and shareholders alike to assess the stre ngth of the Company’s balance sheet.  \nNet cash flow  is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Cash flow from \noperating activities. Net cash flow refers to Cash Flow From Operations excluding working capital minus Net \nInvestments. Net cash flow can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike because it \nillustrates cash flow generated by the operations of the Company post allocation of cash for Organic Investments and \nAcquisitions net of assets  sales (acquisitions - assets sales - other operations with non -controlling interests). This \nperformance indicator corresponds to the cash flow available to repay debt and allocate cash to shareholder \ndistribution or share buybacks.  \nNet investments  is a no n-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS measure is Cash flow \nused in investing activities. Net Investments refer to Cash flow used in investing activities including other \ntransactions with non -controlling interests, including change in debt from renewable projects financing, including \nexpenditures related to carbon credits, including capex linked to capitalized leasing contracts and excluding organic \nloan repayment from equity affiliates. This indicator can be a valuable tool for deci sion makers, analysts and \nshareholders alike to illustrate the cash directed to growth opportunities, both internal and external, thereby showing, \nwhen combined with the Company’s cash flow statement prepared under IFRS, how cash is generated and allocated  \nfor uses within the organization. Net Investments are the sum of Organic Investments and Acquisitions net of assets \nsales each of which is described in the Glossary.  \nOrganic investments  is a non -GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable IFRS  measure is Cash \nflow used in investing activities. Organic investments refers to Net Investments, excluding acquisitions, asset sales \nand other operations with non -controlling interests. Organic Investments can be a valuable tool for decision makers, \nanalysts and shareholders alike because it illustrates cash flow used by the Company to grow its asset base, excluding \nsources of external growth.  \n \n43 Payout  is a non -GAAP financial measure. Payout is defined as the ratio of the dividends and share buybacks for \ncancellation to the Cash Flow From Operations excluding working capital. This indicator can be a valuable tool for \ndecision makers, analysts and shareholders as it provides the portion of the Cash Flow From Operations excluding \nworking capital distributed to  the shareholder.  \nReturn on Average Capital Employed (ROACE)  is a non -GAAP financial measure. ROACE is the ratio of \nAdjusted Net Operating Income to average Capital Employed at replacement cost between the beginning and the end \nof the period. This indicato r can be a valuable tool for decision makers, analysts and shareholders alike to measure \nthe profitability of the Company’s average Capital Employed in its business operations and is used by the Company \nto benchmark its performance internally and externall y with its peers.  \nDisclaimer  \nThe press release presents the results for the third quarter of 2024 and first nine months of 2024 from the consolidated fina ncial \nstatements of TotalEnergies SE as of September 30, 2024 (unaudited). The limited review procedures by the Statutory Auditors \nare underway. The notes to the consolidated financial statements (unaudited) are available on the website totalenergies.com. This \ndocument may contain forward -looking statements (including forward -looking statements within the meaning of the Private \nSecuri ties Litigation Reform Act of 1995), notably with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, business activit ies \nand strategy of TotalEnergies.

Additionally,  certain financial information is based on estimates particularly in the \nassessment of the recoverable value of assets and potential impairments of assets relating thereto. Readers are cautioned not  to \nconsider forward -looking statements as accurate, but a s an expression of the Company’s views only as of the date this document \nis published. TotalEnergies SE and its subsidiaries have no obligation, make no commitment and expressly disclaim any \nresponsibility to investors or any stakeholder to update or revis e, particularly as a result of new information or future events, any \nforward -looking information or statement, objectives or trends contained in this document. In addition, the Company has not \nverified, and is under no obligation to verify any third -party data contained in this document or used in the estimates and \nassumptions or, more generally, forward -looking statements published in this document. The information on risk factors that \ncould have a significant adverse effect on TotalEnergies’ business, fin ancial condition, including its operating income and cash \nflow, reputation, outlook or the value of financial instruments issued by TotalEnergies is provided in the most recent versio n of \nthe Universal Registration Document which is filed by TotalEnergies SE with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. \nAdditionally, the developments of environmental and climate change -related issues in this document are based on various \nframeworks and the interests of various stakeholders which are subject to evolve ind ependently of our will.  \nFinancial information by business segment is reported in accordance with the internal reporting system and shows internal \nsegment information that is used to manage and measure the performance of TotalEnergies. In addition to IFRS measures, certain \nalternative performance indicators are presented, such as performance indicators excluding the adjustment items described bel ow \n(adjusted operating income, adjusted net operating income, adjusted net income), return on equity (ROE), retur n on average capital \nemployed (ROACE), gearing ratio, operating cash flow before working capital changes, the shareholder rate of return. These \nindicators are meant to facilitate the analysis of the financial performance of TotalEnergies and the comparison  of income between \nperiods. They allow investors to track the measures used internally to manage and measure the performance of TotalEnergies.  \nThese adjustment items include:  \n(i) Special items  \nDue to their unusual nature or particular significance, certain  transactions qualifying as \"special items\" are excluded from the \nbusiness segment figures. In general, special items relate to transactions that are significant, infrequent, or unusual. Howe ver, in \ncertain instances, transactions such as restructuring cos ts or assets disposals, which are not considered to be representative of the \nnormal course of business, may qualify as special items although they may have occurred in prior years or are likely to occur  in \nfollowing years.  \n \n44 (ii) The inventory valuation effe ct \nIn accordance with IAS 2, TotalEnergies values inventories of petroleum products in its financial statements according to the  \nFirst-In, First -Out (FIFO) method and other inventories using the weighted -average cost method. Under the FIFO method, the \ncost of inventory is based on the historic cost of acquisition or manufacture rather than the current replacement cost. In volatil e \nenergy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on the reported income. Accordingly, the adjusted results of th e \nRefining & Chemicals and Marketing & Services segments are presented according to the replacement cost method. This method \nis used to assess the segments’ performance and facilitate the comparability of the segments’ performance with those of its m ain \ncompe titors.  \nIn the replacement cost method, which approximates the Last -In, First -Out (LIFO) method, the variation of inventory values in \nthe statement of income is, depending on the nature of the inventory, determined using either the month -end prices differe ntial \nbetween one period and another or the average prices of the period rather than the historical value. The inventory valuation effect \nis the difference between the results under the FIFO and the replacement cost methods.  \n(iii) Effect of changes in fair  value  \nThe effect of changes in fair value presented as an adjustment item reflects, for trading inventories and storage contracts, \ndifferences between internal measures of performance used by TotalEnergies’ Executive Committee and the accounting for these  \ntransactions under IFRS.  \nIFRS requires that trading inventories be recorded at their fair value using period -end spot prices. In order to best reflect the \nmanagement of economic exposure through derivative transactions, internal indicators used to measure  performance include \nvaluations of trading inventories based on forward prices.  \nTotalEnergies, in its trading activities, enters into storage contracts, whose future effects are recorded at fair value in \nTotalEnergies’ internal economic performance. IFRS p recludes recognition of this fair value effect.  \nFurthermore, TotalEnergies enters into derivative instruments to risk manage certain operational contracts or assets. Under I FRS, \nthese derivatives are recorded at fair value while the underlying operational transactions are recorded as they occur. Internal \nindicators defer the fair value on derivatives to match with the transaction occurrence.  \nThe adjusted results (adjusted operating income, adjusted net operating income, adjusted net income) are defined as r eplacement \ncost results, adjusted for special items, excluding the effect of changes in fair value.  \nEuro amounts presented for the fully adjusted -diluted earnings per share represent dollar amounts converted at the average euro -\ndollar (€ -$) exchange rate f or the applicable period and are not the result of financial statements prepared in euros.  \n \n45 Brazil: First oil of Mero 3  \n30 October 2024  – TotalEnergies announces the start of production from the third phase of the Mero field, located \non the Libra block, 180 kilometers off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the Santos pre -salt basin.  \nLaunched in August 2020, the \"Mero -3\" project consists of 15 wells connected to a floating production, storage and \noffloading unit, the FPSO Marechal Duque de Caxi as, with a production capacity of 180,000 barrels of oil per day \n(b/d). Mero -3 has been designed to minimize greenhouse gas emissions, with the associated gas being reinjected into \nthe tank and no routine flaring. The FPSO will later be connected to the HI SEP® pilot project, using innovative high -\npressure subsea separation technology. Currently under development, this pilot project will separate oil from high -\nCO gas2 at seabed level, allowing the gas to be reinjected directly into the reservoir.  \nWith the st art-up of Mero -3, the total production capacity of the Mero field will reach 590,000 bbls/d. An additional \nphase of development, \"Mero -4\", with a capacity of 180,000 b/d, is under construction and is expected to start in \n2025. At full capacity, TotalEnergi es' share of Mero's production is expected to exceed 100,000 b/d.  \n“The start of Mero -3 production, less than a year after Mero -2, marks a new milestone for TotalEnergies in Brazil, a \npriority growth area for the Company. With its vast resources and top -notch productivity, Mero's development \nensures low -cost, low -emission oil production, in line with our Company's strategy,\" said Nicolas Terraz, Executive \nVice President, Exploration & Production at TotalEnergies. \"In the coming years, we will continue our gr owth in \nBrazil with the start -up of Mero -4, expected in 2025, as well as two recently launched projects: Atapu -2 and Sepia -\n2.” \nMero is a unitized field, operated by Petrobras (38.6%) in partnership with TotalEnergies (19.3%), Shell Brasil \n(19.3%), CNPC (9. 65%), CNOOC (9.65%) and Pré -Sal Petróleo S.A. (PPSA, 3.5%) representing the government in \nthe non -contractual zone.  \nDenmark: TotalEnergies discovers new gas condensate resources at the Harald offshore field   \n29 October 2024  - TotalEnergies announces that t he Harald East Middle Jurassic exploration well (HEMJ -1X) has \ndiscovered new gas -to-condensate resources in the Harald field in the Danish North Sea.  \nLocated in conventional offshore, 250 kilometers off the west coast of Denmark, the HEMJ -1X well was drill ed in \nthe eastern part of the Harald field and encountered 48 meters of gas condensate in a good quality reservoir.  \nThe HEMJ -1X well will be immediately connected to the Harald platform and is expected to begin production before \nthe end of the year via the  existing Harald and Tyra infrastructure.  \n“The success of the Harald East Middle Jurassic well, located near our Harald facility in Denmark, illustrates the \nstrength of our exploration strategy. This additional discovery on the Harald field will contribute  to Denmark's energy \nsupply by increasing our current production in the North Sea, in line with the Danish 'National Compromise', ” said \nKevin McLachlan, Senior Vice President, Exploration at TotalEnergies.  \nTotalEnergies is the operator on behalf of the Dan ish Underground Consortium, a partnership between TotalEnergies \n(43.2%), BlueNord (36.8%) and Nordsøfonden (20%).  \nRenewables & Green Hydrogen: TE H2, CIP and A.P. Møller Capital join forces for a Large -Scale Project in \nthe Kingdom of Morocco  \n28 October 2024  - Under the chairmanship of HM King Mohammed VI of Morocco, and H.E. Emmanuel Macron, \nPresident of the French Republic, the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco and TE H2 with its partners, have \nsigned a Preliminary Land Reservation Contract for the \"Chbika\"  project.  \nThis agreement will allow TE H2, a joint venture between TotalEnergies and the EREN Group, together with the \ntwo Danish companies,  Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners  (CIP), through its  Energy Transition Fund, and A.P. \nMøller Capital, through its  Emerging Markets Infrastructure Fund, to launch the front -end studies.  \nLocated near the Atlantic coast in the Guelmim -Oued Noun region, the \"Chbika\" project aims to build 1 GW of \nonshore solar and wind capacity that will power the production of green hydro gen by electrolysis of desalinated \nseawater and its transformation into 200,000 tons per year of green ammonia for the European market. This project \nwill be the first phase of a development program aimed at creating a world -scale green hydrogen production center.  \n \n46 TE H2 and CIP will be in charge of developing renewable energy production (solar, wind, green hydrogen and its \nderivatives), while A.P. Møller Capital will develop the port and associated infrastructure. This contract, a first in \nMorocco, will high light the country's exceptional renewable potential and contribute to the Kingdom's economic \ndevelopment.  \nPatrick Pouyanné, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TotalEnergies , said: “I would like to thank the Moroccan \nauthorities for awarding the \"Chbik a\" project and the confidence they have shown in our subsidiary TE H2 and our \npartners. This agreement is part of our strategy to develop production in countries with the most competitive \nrenewable resources such as Morocco that can be exported to Europe. Thanks to its geographical proximity and the \nquality of its wind and solar resources, Morocco has the best assets to become a major partner of Europe in achieving \nthe objectives of the  Green Deal  and TotalEnergies aims to contribute to it. ” \nDavid Corchia, Managing Director of TE H2 , added: “The signing of this Preliminary Land Reservation Agreement \nis a decisive first step towards the launch of our investment program in Morocco. This demonstrates our commitment \nto developing green hydrogen initiatives that support the energy transition, industrialization and job creation in the \ncountry.

The transaction involves a network of about 240 filling stations and several \nstorage facilities for petroleum products and et hanol.  \nSIM Distribuidora, one of the recognized players of the fuel distribution business in Brazil, belongs to Grupo \nArgenta, which has more than 500 service stations, lubricants and aviation activities.  \nThis sale reflects the selective strategy of TotalE nergies in Marketing & Services in the retail network business \nfocussed on core geographies with significant market share positions. The Company will retain its lubricants blending \nand distribution activities in Brazil.  \nThe acquisition remains subject to a uthorization by the relevant authorities.  \nTotalEnergies expands global LNG bunkering footprint  \n10 October 2024 - TotalEnergies has signed a charter contract with Spanish shipowner Ibaizabal for a new Liquefied \nNatural Gas (LNG) bunker vessel of 18,600m3 ca pacity. This new vessel will expand the Company’s global presence \nin bunkering hubs. In particular, this additional vessel might be deployed in Oman, where the Company is developing \nthe Marsa LNG project with the objective to provide LNG to the shipping se ctor in the Gulf.  \nThe vessel, owned by Ibaizabal, will supply LNG to a wide range of vessels (containerships, tankers, large cruise \nships, ferries) at TotalEnergies’ LNG bunkering hubs and meet the highest technical and environmental standards.  \nUsed as a m arine fuel, LNG is an immediately available transition fuel that reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \nin the shipping sector by around 20%. It also significantly improves air quality by reducing nitrogen oxides (NOx) \nemissions by up to 85%, and it almost  completely eliminates (by 99%) sulfur oxides (SOx) and fine particules. These \nbenefits are particularly impactful when ships are at berth, improving the quality of life for port cities and \ncommunities in coastal areas.  \n \n47 This new vessel, currently being con structed by Hudong –Zhonghua Shipbuilding in China, will be delivered by the \nend of 2026 and will join TotalEnergies’ current fleet of three deployed LNG bunker vessels: the Gas Agility, which \nhas been positioned in the Port of Rotterdam, the Gas Vitality, operated in the Port of Marseille and the Brassavola \nlocated in the Port of Singapore.  \n“We are very proud of this agreement with Ibaizabal, which reinforces our position as a main player in LNG \nbunkering” said Louise Tricoire, TotalEnergies Senior Vice Pre sident, Aviation and Marine Fuels. “With new LNG -\nfuelled vessels coming on stream at a rapid pace, we are committed to playing our part in responding to the sector’s \nincreasing demand for this fuel which can help global shipping meet its decarbonization am bitions.”  \nMr Jorge Zickermann, CEO Ibaizabal Group, said, “Ibaizabal is honoured to be chosen to carry out this Project as it \nfalls within our strategy of decarbonizing the maritime industry, together with a leading company in the LNG field, \nwhile enhancin g the already long -term relationship in shipping with TotalEnergies.”  \nLNG’s role in shipping’s energy transition  \nUsed as a marine fuel, LNG helps cut greenhouse gas emissions by around 20% compared to conventional marine \nfuel and has the potential to reduc e emissions significantly more if bio or synthetic LNG is used. As such, marine \nLNG is a sustainable, affordable and immediately available way of reducing emissions in the shipping sector. \nTotalEnergies has actively invested in LNG bunkering infrastructure , critical to supporting its shipping customers' \nadoption of LNG as a marine fuel.  \nTotalEnergies, the world’s third largest LNG player  \nTotalEnergies is the world’s third largest LNG player with a global portfolio of 44 Mt/y in 2023 thanks to its interests \nin liquefaction plants in all geographies. The Company benefits from an integrated position across the LNG value \nchain, including production, transportation, access to more than 20 Mt/y of regasification capacity in Europe, trading, \nand LNG bunkering. Tota lEnergies’ ambition is to increase the share of natural gas in its sales mix to close to 50% \nby 2030, to reduce carbon emissions and eliminate methane emissions associated with the gas value chain, and to \nwork with local partners to promote the transition from coal to natural gas.  \nDecarbonizing French Industry: TotalEnergies Signs a Renewable Electricity Supply Agreement with  Saint -\nGobain  \n8 October 2024 - TotalEnergies has signed with Saint -Gobain a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), under which \nTotalEnergies will supply renewable electricity to Saint -Gobain’s French facilities.

The webcast of the presentation in English is available on \ntotalenergies.com.  \nTotalEnergies advances its balanced and profitable transition strategy anchored on two pillars: Oil & Gas, notably \nLNG, and e lectricity, growing its global energy production (oil, gas, electricity, bioenergy) by 4% per year through \n2030 while drastically lowering the emissions from its operations ( -40% on Scope 1+2 net in 2030 vs 2015 and - \n80% on methane in 2030 vs 2020). As a result of this transition strategy, the average carbon content of TotalEnergies \nenergy sales will be 25% lower in 2030 vs 2015.  \nSince its last outlook in September 2023, TotalEnergies has de -risked its growth and profitability perspectives in \nseveral ways:  \n• Oil & Gas production average growth of ~3% per year to 2030, led by LNG, thanks to the launch of six \nmajor projects in 2024 (two in Brazil, Suriname, Angola, Oman, Nigeria) that de -risk, high -grade and extend \nguidance from 2028 to 2030. Over the next two years 2025 and 2026, growth will exceed 3% per year due \nto the start -up of several high margin projects (US GoM, Brazil, Iraq, Uganda, Argentina, Malaysia, Qatar) \nwhich are accretive in net income per barrel and cash -flow per barrel. In 2024, the Compa ny has also de -\nrisked its LNG exposure to spot gas prices by signing long -term LNG sales contracts mainly indexed on \nBrent and by developing its upstream gas production in the US through two low -cost acquisitions.  \nNatural gas is indeed at the core of Total Energies’ transition strategy through an outstanding LNG growth \n(+50% over 2024 -2030) and a gas -to-power integration supporting its profitable Integrated Power strategy \nto complement the intermittent renewables.  \n• Growing electricity generation, reaching mor e than 100 TWh in 2030, of which 70% will be renewable and \n30% flexible -based. It will represent nearly 20% of global energy production of the Company. By actively \ncompleting in 2024 its integrated model in key targeted deregulated markets, Integrated Powe r is making \nprogress on its main levers to achieve at least 12% ROACE by 2028 -2030 and will be net cash positive by \n2028.  \nTotalEnergies confirms net investments between $16 -18 billion per year during 2025 -2030, of which around $5 \nbillion will be dedicated to low -carbon energies. The Company retains flexibility to reduce its net investments by $2 \nbillion in case of a sharp drop in prices.  \nThanks to this clear and disciplined investment policy and the perspective for +$10 billion of free cash flow growth \nby 2030 (versus 2024 at same price deck), the Board of Directors has confirmed a shareholder return5 of over 40% \nof cash flow through cycles and has made the following decisions:  \n• In 2024, execute $8 billion in share buybacks6, corresponding to approximately 5% of the Company’s \ncapital. Anticipated shareholder return2 is above 45% of 2024 cash flow.  \n• In 2025, continue share buybacks3 of $2 billion per quarter assuming reasonable market conditions, and \nincrease the dividend per share by at least 5% based on the 2024 share buybacks.  \nSuriname:  TotalEnergies announces Final Investment Decision for the GranMorgu development on Block 58  \n1 October 2024 - Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies, met today in Paramaribo with His \nExcellency Chandrikapersad Santokhi, President of the Republic of Suriname, and Annand Jagesar, CEO of \nStaatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V., Suriname’s National Oil Company, to announce the Final Investment \nDecision (FID) for the “GranMorgu” development located on o ffshore Block 58.  \n“GranMorgu” means both “new dawn” and “Goliath grouper” in Sranan Tongo, the  local language.  \nA landmark project in a prolific basin  \n \n5 Payout = (dividends + share buybacks for cancellation) / CFFO  \n6 Including coverage of employees share grant plans  \n \n \n50 The GranMorgu project will develop the Sapakara and Krabdagu oil discoveries, on which a successful explor ation \nand appraisal campaign was completed in 2023.

After it was contacted by the author of the article, and given the seriousness \nof the allegations, TotalEnergies requested Mozambique LNG to clarify whether it had  any information indicating \nthat such events took place. Mozambique LNG has conducted internal verifications and confirmed that it had no \nknowledge of the alleged events described in the article and had never received any information indicating that such \nevents took place, despite maintaining a close communication with the local communities.  \nWe hereby reproduce Mozambique LNG response to the author of the article on September 3, 2024:  \n“Mozambique LNG would like to clearly state that it has no knowledge of t he alleged events described in your “Story \nSummary” and has never received any information indicating that such events took place.  \n1) During the period from April to November 2021, and contrary to your assertion, no Mozambique LNG personnel \nwas present at the Afungi site, which was under the control of the Mozambican public security forces. More \nspecifically:  \n• Following the start of the attacks on the city of Palma on 24 March 2021, Mozambique LNG project \norganized two evacuations by ferry, respectively on 2 7 and 30 March. Through these ferry evacuations, \nover 2 500 persons, including both personnel of Mozambique LNG and its contractors and civilians who \nhad taken refuge at the entrance of the Mozambique LNG Project Site, were transported to the city of \nPemba . \n• All the employees of Mozambique LNG, its contractors and subcontractors were safely evacuated from the \nMozambique LNG Project Site. Furthermore, Mozambique LNG also evacuated many civilians thanks to \nits personnel who remained at the site as long as safe ly possible to keep the port and airport in operation.  \n• The last remaining Mozambique LNG personnel were evacuated on 2 April 2021, and on that date the \nAfungi Site was handed over to the Mozambican public security forces.  \n•  No Mozambique LNG personnel returned to the Afungi site until November 2021.  \n2) During the period between April to November 2021, despite having no physical presence in Afungi, Mozambique \nLNG maintained a close communication with local communities and made over 1200 phone  calls with community \nleaders, community facilitators and people affected by the project. None of these calls mentioned the alleged events \ndescribed in your “Story Summary”.  \n3) Mozambique LNG is following strict adherenc e to the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights \n(VPSHR) notably through the following actions:  \n• The implementation of a grievance mechanism. This grievance mechanism was effectively used by local \ncommunities in 2021 and is still being used. Despi te this mechanism being used by the communities the \nalleged events were never reported.  \n• Carrying out VPSHR trainings for the Mozambican public security forces (at this date more than 5000 \nsecurity personnel benefited from those trainings).  \n• Access to Justic e and remedies to victims promoted via a dedicated MoU between Mozambique LNG and \nthe Ministry of Justice. Within this framework logistic support is being provided to the Minister of Justice \nto help with the return post crisis in the area of Palma District  of judges, prosecutors and also the Legal \nAid Board in Palma District.  \n4) After the attacks in Palma, Mozambique LNG provided emergency aid and humanitarian support to the local \ncommunities, through local NGOs. Around 400 tonnes of humanitarian aid was di stributed to the affected \ncommunities and internally displaced persons (IDPs) after the attacks and throughout 2021. In addition, over 320 \ntonnes of food were distributed to IDPs in Mocimboa da Praia and Afungi area, and around 200 tonnes of food were \ndistributed to IDP centers in the southern part of the Cabo Delgado province. Also, over 277,000 meals were \n \n53 distributed to vulnerable families in the Palma and Afungi areas. During this period, Mozambique LNG maintained \nregular communications with the NGOs inv olved in the community support programs and the alleged events were \nnever raised.  \nNevertheless, given the gravity of the allegations, we are taking your message very seriously. We would therefore \nlike to request you to provide all the factual elements, evi dential data and supporting material that relate to the \naccount of events that you present.”  \nNorway : Northern Lights facilities completed and ready to store C 02 \n26 September 2024 - TotalEnergies and its partners, Equinor and Shell, announce the completion of the CO2 \nreceiving and storage facilities of Northern Lights Joint -Venture in Norway.

In 2022 and 2023, \nAir France -KLM was the world's leading SAF user, representing 17% and 16% of total global production \nrespectively.  \nAccelerating the decarbonization of air transport in Europe  \nThis contract builds on a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed in 2022 for the supply of 800,000 tons of \nSAF. By re -evaluating this agreement today, the two groups are reaffirming their objective to curb the environmental \nimpact of the air transport sector as quickly as possible by reducing CO2 emissions.  \nBy 20 30, Air France -KLM aims to reduce its CO2 emissions per passenger/km by 30% compared with 2019 levels. \nThe Group aims to achieve this goal through a combination of fleet renewal, operational measures such as eco -\npiloting, and the incorporation of at least 10% of more sustainable aviation fuel on all its flights. These ambitious \ntargets go beyond regulatory obligations.  \nThe SAF supplied to Air France -KLM will be made from waste and residues from the circular economy and will be \nproduced in TotalEnergies' Fre nch and European biorefineries and refineries by coprocessing. This SAF will be used \nto fuel flights operated by Air France -KLM’s airlines on departure from France, the Netherlands, and other European \ncountries. The development of SAF is at the heart of To talEnergies' transition strategy to meet demand from the \naviation sector.  \nAir France -KLM has implemented a strict sourcing policy, purchasing only second -generation SAF that does not \ncompete with global food production, and that is RSB or ISCC+ certified f or its sustainability.  \nSAF allows for a reduction in CO₂ emissions of at least 75% and up to 90% over the entire fuel life cycle, compared \nwith fossil fuel equivalents.  \n“SAF contributes both to the energy transition of our customers in the aviation sector and to the industrial transition \nof our refineries. It therefore represents a real 'win -win' for the future of industry and aviation”, said Patrick \nPouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies. “For the past 10 years, we have been pioneers in the field, inv esting \nin biorefineries and SAF production facilities in France as well as developing coprocessing technologies in our \nrefineries. Building on these industrial successes, we intend to continue this momentum in Europe and worldwide.”  \n“Securing the volumes o f more sustainable aviation fuel needed to decarbonize our activity is a major challenge. \nThis agreement with TotalEnergies is a further step in this direction, and a testament to our long -standing support \nfor the development of SAF production in France an d Europe. A solid SAF sector capable of meeting our industry’s \nneeds is a key factor in Europe’ sovereignty and energy independence,” said Benjamin Smith, Chief Executive \nOfficer of Air France -KLM Group.  \nA long -standing partnership between TotalEnergies an d Air France -KLM  \nFor the past 10 years, TotalEnergies and the Air France -KLM Group have been working together to test and \nincorporate sustainable aviation fuel. This partnership began in 2014 with “Lab’line for the Future”, a two -year \nexperiment during whi ch 78 Air France flights between Paris -Orly and Toulouse, and between Paris -Orly and Nice \nwere fueled with 10% SAF supplied by TotalEnergies.  \nIn January 2020, TotalEnergies and Air France took part, alongside Safran and Suez, in the Call for Expressions of  \nInterest launched by the French government to encourage the emergence of a French SAF production industry.  \n \n55 Since 2022, TotalEnergies has been supplying SAF to Air France -KLM Group airlines in France, as part of the \nFrench incorporation mandate.  \nFrench and  European SAF production  \nTotalEnergies is investing heavily in projects to produce more sustainable aviation fuel in France and Europe:  \nIn Grandpuits: TotalEnergies is transforming the site into a zero -oil platform with an investment of 400 million euros. \nMainly focused on the production of SAF from the circular economy, Grandpuits will be able to produce 210,000 \ntons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2025, and an additional 75,000 tons by 2027.  \nIn Normandy: TotalEnergies has started producing SAF at its Gonf reville refinery. The company plans to increase \nproduction to 160,000 tons of SAF per year by 2025.  \nAt La Mède: TotalEnergies has invested 340 million euros to transform its refinery into a biorefinery. In 2024, \nTotalEnergies has invested an additional 70 million euros to process up to 100% waste from the circular economy \nand produce SAF by 2025. Since 2021, biodiesel produced at La Mède has been used to produce SAF at \nTotalEnergies' Oudalle plant near Le Havre.  \nTotalEnergies is studying the production of S AF through co -processing in its other European refineries by 2025.  \nArgentina : Production Start -up at Fenix Offshore Gas Field  \n20 September 2024 - TotalEnergies announces the start of production from the Fenix gas field, located 60 km off \nthe coast of Tierr a del Fuego in Southern Argentina.  \nThe Fenix field is part of the Cuenca Marina Austral 1 (CMA -1) concession, in which TotalEnergies holds a 37.5% \noperated interest, alongside its partners Harbour Energy (37.5%) and Pan American Energy (25%).  \nWith a production capacity of 10 million cubic meters per day (70,000 boe/d), the Fenix development consists of a \nnew unmanned platform, located in 70 meters water depth and connected to the existing CMA -1 facilities. Gas \nproduced at Fenix is sent through a 35 -kilometer subsea pipeline to the TotalEnergies -operated Véga Pléyade \nplatform and is subsequently treated onshore at the Río Cullen and Cañadon Alfa facilities, which are also operated \nby the Company. Fenix is a low cost, low emissions development, with a ca rbon intensity of 9 kg CO2e/boe, \nleveraging on the existing infrastructure.  \n\"The start -up of Fenix production safely and ahead of schedule, only two years after FID, demonstrates the capacity \nof our Company to deliver its projects.
